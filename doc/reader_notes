Want ~25 lines per page, with ~10 paragraphs = 32.5 normal lines
~12 words per line

Each paragraph is 1.75 normal lines 

Algorithmish: 

Open file
put 32 lines into local buffer
for each line
  pull from buffer
  count words 
  wrapped_lines_per = round( words/12.0 )
  if (wrapped_lines + wrapped_lines_per )
    wrapped_lines += wrapped_lines_per
  else
    remaining_space = 32 - wrapped_lines
    pull off lines that we need 
    put the rest back in buffer
  break if no remaining space
