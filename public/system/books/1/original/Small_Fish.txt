December 15th 1988.  London, England. Maurice Vigor knew he was dying.      Night was closing in.  Shop lights on the damp pavement mingled with the yellow glow of the street lamps; a thin cold fog ghosted the pinched faces of the few Tuesday shoppers.     A bus crawled by half empty.  Impatient drivers tapped their fingers,  waiting for the lights to change.   Trucks hissed their airbrakes in frustration.     The sounds and the shadows came to Maurice as he sat in the front room above the shop.       Suddenly cold, he leaned forward and lit the gas fire.  The Orange Cat left his lap for the greater heat the fire gave and lay belly towards the flames. A jangled thump tumbled up the stairs pursued by the snick of bolts.  Maurice opened his eyes, waiting.  Jenny had locked the shop door.  Would she come up?  The side door clicked quietly shut.  Pity.  He would have liked a cup of tea.     Perhaps she had shopping to do.  She usually went to Sainsbury's on Thursdays.  Perhaps she had a date, needed something special in for a repas a deux.  For a moment the thought of food made him hungry,  but it passed.       He didn't bother with the news.  What was it to him?  Violence, poverty, the constant betrayal of the governed abroad and at home.  Then, the jovial trivia that made it all alright.     The side door opened and shut.       She was back.  Something forgotten?     The tread up the stairs was heavy.      Mechanically, the clock measured minutes.  Ten past eight.       The door to the kitchen opened.     "Do you want a cup of tea, Maurice?"     "That would be most welcome, Jack," Maurice turned his head to make his voice carry.     The lid of the kettle clattered on the draining board, cups chinked.     "Well, what did they say?"     "I'll live," lied Maurice.     "No problems?"     "Hospital car, there and back."      "Any pain?"     "Not much; more pills though."  Maurice looked up at their serried ranks on the mantle piece.  Enough to make me rattle, he thought, and none of them any bloody good.     Jack came in, handed Maurice a hot cup, dumped himself down in the chair opposite, and searched his friend's face for truth.     "How long?" he said after a moment.     "Years," said Maurice.     "I've known you too long for this. Tell me."  Jack took Maurice's free hand in his own.  "How long?"     "Six months, if I'm lucky."   I've seen my last summer' Maurice thought, as he knelled the words.     "Have you eaten?"     Maurice shook his head.     Hungry?"     "Picky," said Maurice, "a bit."     "Cheese and biscuits?"  Jack's wife had died of cancer.     Maurice nodded, "In a minute."     Silence enfolded them.      "Jenny been up?"     "This morning, to have some cheques signed."     "She's a good lass; you're lucky there."     "Jack."     "Yes."     "Will you take some things to the bank for me?"     "Of course, anything I can do." Maurice pointed to a tied and sealed bundle on the floor.  "Those, and this letter, just instructions to them."  He pulled the slightly crumpled envelope from his jacket pocket.     Jack repocketed it, "I'll do it tomorrow lunch time.  Hiding the evidence are you?"     Maurice laughed, "Signed copies of Mein Kampf no less."     "I'd better do the same with my Lenin’s when the time comes then."     Memories lingere[CJ1]d.        "I'd like a drink."  He'd hardly touched his now cold tea.     Jack got up, "Schnapps?"     "Please," said Maurice.  Both men knew it now could do no harm.  That, at least, was one consolation.     He handed Maurice a generous measure.  "I don't know how you drink that stuff."     "Is your objection based on taste or politics?"       "Taste.  I gave up trying to convert you thirty years ago."     "So you did".  The fire burned its way down, warming breath and stomach.  "And there'll be no death bed repentance."     "Still a Fascist pig."  Jack saluted him with his empty cup.     "Still a Marxist pig."  Maurice returned the salute and then drained the glass.  "Another."     Jack  left the bottle by the chair.     "Is there anyone else, anywhere, you'd want me to..." He let the sentence finish itself.     "No. No one," said Maurice.     The silence came back.     "I had… have a son," said Maurice.     Jack's head jerked up out of his reverie.     "What!" he said.  "You never said."     "That got you," smiled Maurice. "Some old queers have children."      Jack ignored the self deprecation as he had always done.     "Tell me about him?"     Maurice shook his head, "Not much to tell.  Francoise left me before he was born."     "You’ve never seen him?"     "Fetch me that book, will you?"  Maurice pointed to the shelf in the alcove. "The Lawrence, Sons and Lovers, and mind it, it's a first edition."     Jack brought it over.  Maurice opened it and drew out a photograph.[CJ2]  "That's him, with his wife, 1982.  Francoise sent it to me.  The only picture and the only thing I ever heard from her."  Maurice took it back from Jack, replaced it, and closed the book.     "You've never contacted him?"     "Never."     "You should."  Jack was firm about that.     "No."  So was Maurice.     "He might need..,want to know."  Jack was struggling.     "He doesn't need and he wouldn't want to know."     "How can you be so sure?"  Jack was not going to give up, yet.     Maurice sighed.  "About a year after that photo, I went to the address on the back. I didn't call; I just watched, followed him, and then came home."     "Didn't you want to?"      "Yes," Maurice interrupted, "Of course I did, but I had come with too much past."  He held up his hand before Jack could ask.  "He has a house, a wife, children now for all I know. He has a life.  What he does not need is me, especially now."   He was beginning to regret his revelation.       Jack put the book back on the shelf.     "Got anything else apart from that?" He waved at the bottle by the chair.     "There's whisky in the sideboard."     Jack topped a glass and sat down again.  He was obviously uneasy.  "Family matters," he said.     "Not family, a biological accident," said Maurice.     "Still flesh and blood," replied Jack.     Blood and honour, thought Maurice and a dagger of what might have been turned in his heart.       "Leave it," Maurice said, "How's business?"     "It's been better, but I'll survive."  Jack sipped at his whisky, still thinking of Maurice's son.     "The luxury of a private income," said Maurice.     "Three flats don't make me rich," retorted Jack.     "But they make you a bourgeoise rentier. Come your revolution, you'll be first up against the wall."     "Bollocks;" said Jack finishing his drink.  "And you're still wrong. You should write to him at least.  What's he called?"     "Matthew."     Jack looked at him.     Maurice shrugged, "No idea. I don't know any Matthews. Didn't think she did either."     "Eat now?"  Jack got up.     Maurice nodded.     He ate a little. Jack left the bottle with the tray. They talked.  Jack did not mention Matthew again.  He left just after ten, promising to call in after he'd been to the bank.  Maurice followed the steps down the stairs and waited for the door to slam shut.  Slowly he stood up and washed a couple of painkillers down with more Schnapps.  He was tired. Jack was a good man but he could rabbit on.     "Too many years on street corners preaching the true faith," he told Orange Cat, who having just eaten, was indifferent.       Maurice took a pen and paper from the desk and sat back in the chair.  He could feel the pain easing.  He had been told he would have good days and bad days.  Today he supposed was somewhere in the middle.  He lifted up the tray to rest on.      He had started the letter many times but could not continue it.  What could he say?  What could he tell someone whom he had never met and probably thought Maurice long dead?  No, he could say nothing.  He would write no apologia and he would not pass on the poisoned chali[CJ3]ce of his life.  He threw the last attempt into the bin to join the others.  He sat back, warmer now - less tired, too.      He filled his glass again and let the hovering memories in.  It was suddenly Spring, and his beloved Ernst was speaking to him.      "You should retire, sell your shop, go somewhere warm."  Ernst's face showed his care for Maurice.     "Are you retiring?  Then neither am I."       "But I am not ill.  Why not come home with me to Cape Town. Take a long holiday. Relax.  You have earned that."  Ernst meant what he said.     "Have I?  Have I really, Ernst.  Tell me then, what have I managed in these last thirty years?"     "More than you suspect."     "It could hardly be less," said Maurice.     Ernst shook his head, "You expected too much too soon, but the harvest will not be long."     "Abroad perhaps."     "Here too. Do you remember what you told me in the mid '50's?".  Ernst ticked off the points on his fingers. "That [CJ4]there was no one of old comrades from before the war who still believed; that the right was essentially conservative, not revolutionary; that the tradition of the Monarchy, especially with the new Queen, militated against a leadership cult."     "Yes I remember.  I also said there was no popular tradition of abstract political philosophy as in France", said Maurice.     "And what did I tell you to do?"     “'Wait'” you said, “'Time is on our side.'”  Maurice got up and brought a bottle from the sideboard.     Ernst held out his glass to be filled.  "Look around you, old friend. Look around you now.  What real leadership has your government given apart from window dressing?  Your industries are gone; you can no longer afford your vaunted 'Welfare State'; the poor get poorer; the rich are dissatisfied.  Your country teems with immigrants undermining your culture and traditions, and the days of the monarchy are numbered.  Good soil, would you not say?     Maurice nodded. "That is true."     "When you came home to London, for us, England was a desert.  But it was I who asked you to return.  That you could not raise a crop was not your fault - if there be any - but mine.  Here in your shop are the books for those who want to read and learn.  That is your great service."     "But who reads them?"  Maurice paced the room, "Not the young, not the ones we need."     "They do not need to read.  They have other tasks to do."     "I have had no part in that."  Maurice sat down, "No part at all."     "Are you a street fighter, a rabble rouser?  Would you do it all?  They are a smoke screen, useful but of no real matter.  They keep the attention of the people on a minority they need not fear.  They are to be seen.  But where is your left wing press?  Where are your unions? Where is the socialist message?  Gone, all gone.  Your country moves to the right, from the top to the bottom. The centre has shifted our way.  In that, you have played your part, more than you can ever know.  Believe it."  Ernst took a sip from his drink.     Maurice sat, saying nothing.     "Maurice," Ernst lent fo[CJ5]rward a little. Listen carefully to me. Within a year at most Germany will be united.  The Wall will come down.  After that, the rotten Eastern bloc will fall and with it the USSR and communism.  Many who have worked for that for forty years will not be there to see it.  Some grew old, some died young in the camps of Siberia but their names will not be forgotten.  Neither shall you be."     Ernst faded from Maurice’s memory and the chair was emp[CJ6]ty again.  An unwiped tear fell onto Maurice's hand.  Had that been only April?  He had felt well then, no pains, no exhaustion.  So slow to grow until it was ready and then so fast to destroy.  He reached out for two more pills.     Music blared out.  He jerked awake.  The car screamed away from the lights; its sound faded slowly.     Ten past three a.m.     His body was stiff from sitting.  He must go to bed…in a while.     Should he call Ernst?      No.  Ernst would be back to see him in the spring, as he did every year.  He would live until then.       But what of Julien?   He had never told Ernst of the blackmail.  No, there was no threat. Not now.  And Julien had too much to lose if he were exposed - just let that die with him.     He wiped the half formed tear and picked at the remaining cheese.       He must lie down.  If he felt better tomorrow he would spend some time in the shop.  Christmas was a good time for business.     He put out the fire and light.  Orange Cat padded up the stairs ahead of him; slowly he followed.  He was sweating as he undressed. He opened the window a little.  The low cloud held the glow of the city lights, as it had the fires of long ago.  Somewhere close by, a radio played.  He lay down leaving the small bed table light on. The tiny bulb glinted on the silver frame of the photograph and on the gilding of the Byzantine icon hanging above the bed.     He propped himself more comfortably on the pillows.  Orange Cat moved against his side. Maurice closed his eyes.  He could still hear the music, now the low wail of a saxaphone, long remembered from another land.  The ghosts of past lovers pressed close [CJ7]about him.     Claude and Francoise stood at the foot of the bed, smiling, waiting.  Eric, sad Eric, was there.[CJ8] "Not yet," he whispered, "But soon."     He was hot.  The pills and the Schnapps made his head swim and he couldn't focus his thoughts.  He remembered being on a train long ago, with a sailor who smiled and spoke to him in English.    But now, it didn't matter.      Nothing mattered.	 December 20th. 1988.       "Jesus Christ, it's cold!"  Matthew's words clouded round his face.       His eyes hurt in the indecently bright light of the still morning.  He looked at his watch.  Ten thirty and the cemetery was empty, apart from a forlorn and distant figure bent over a headstone.     He pulled the letter from his pocket.              'Dear Mr. Vigor,                          I am sorry to tell you that your father died suddenly on the fifteenth of  December.  He will be buried at ten a.m. on the twentieth, at the North London Cemetery.                      Yours faithfully,                    Jack Dobson,  (071 267 3703)               "To the point," he thought and put the envelope and his hand back into his pocket.     The lettered stones age[CJ9]d silently into the distance either side of the frost-bound gravel of the neat path.  He looked around.  Not even a hole or a pile of earth.  The small building by the gate - he'd taken it to be the chapel that had been locked when he had come in.     Had he missed it?  All done in thirty minutes?     Of course he had missed it; though not by thirty minutes.       More like thirty-six years and six months; after all his mother ought to know when his father had died.     "So why the letter?" Eddie called [CJ10]from the kitchen as he lit the gas under the percolator and listened to Matthew`s incredulous first reading and immediate comments.  "You're free first two, aren't you?" Eddie continued, "Then it's junior assembly till lunch.  No one'll miss you and I can cover your form.  You may as well go and see, just in case."     So Matthew had gone and now the cold had taken hold of his feet numbing them in the hardening dampness of yesterday's socks.     "Would be time better spent if I'd gone to the laundrette," he muttered. "Bloody hoax."     But why a hoax?  And who was Jack Dobson?  He'd rung the number.  No reply.       The letter had been written on the sixteenth.  It had reached his flat, Sue's flat, on the seventeenth and she'd sent it on to Ed[CJ11]die's.  He had got it first post this morning.     He stomped his feet, breaking the fragile ice bond and twisting the gravel into tiny mounds as he turned to go.  Way over to his right a small group processed between the neat clipped hedge and the low-railed tombs that bounded the eastern entrance.     He cut across the white hoared grass towards them, then held back, just in case.     Three men had their backs to him.  One fat. One fatter - the black cloth of his overcoat strained across the shoulders and flared out at the hips.  The third man, slighter, taller, stood apart from them.     The pall bearers - professional mourning men in their dark suits and black scarves - stood, hands clasped, by the side of the lowered coffin with their eyes cast down.          "For man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live, and is full of misery..."      The words hung in the misted air.  Matthew heard them like the distant traffic and the silver angel cutting the blue bright sky three miles above.  Heade[CJ12]d, differently by the frozen tableau where each man appeared locked in his own thoughts.     " Misery, oh boy you could say that again."  Matthew tried to wriggle his toes inside his cold boots.  Five days to Christmas, two till the end of term - usually a time of relief, but not this time.  This time his marriage was really over and he'd already spent an uncomfortable, though not ungrateful, week on a camp bed in Eddie's spare room.  "Bloody women."       There were no women here.     "Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts..."     The priest’s hands were white against the black bound book and his lined face ,like his worn cassock, had seen better days.     "Judge Eternal, suffer us not at out last hour...."          Matthew noticed that the fat man and the fatter were holding hands.      There were no flowers, just one wreath of white and red carnations bound into a circle with black crepe.  He was too far away to read the card.     "...To take unto himself the soul of our dear brother, Maurice Vigor, here departed we therefore commit his body to the ground...."     The sudden words cut into Matthew. He lurched forward, stopping himself as the priest looked up.     "...Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust..."     His father?  Not dead?   For thirty six years he could have known him?  But for five days - five days too late.       Matthew could not make his mind focus.  Time crashed in spraying questions then ebbed back, sucking emotions and  rolling memorie[CJ13]s.       The priest had stopped.  He looked round, nodded and then set off back to the warmth of his hidden sacristy.  The pall bearers, their duties now done and their solemnity fading, followed.       Matthew moved closer to the grave.  The coffin shone black in the pit of the hard soil.  Tarpaulined behind the priest's stand, the burden lay waiting for the digger and the lone wreath for the mound.  He leaned forw[CJ14]ard to read the card.          Maurice,            In his heart, always, one of us.                                           Ernst.     Matthew read it again.  It made no sense, but then, why should it?  He knew nothing of this man, his father.     In the corner of the card was the logo of the winged messenge[CJ15]r.   He shrugged and stood up, aware of someone beside him.     "Mr. Vigor?  Matthew?"  The voice belonged to the taller man who had stood apart from the fat pair.       "Yes."  Matthew answered carefully, aware that the fat pair had also gone.  "I am Matthew Vigor."     The man held out his hand, "Jack Dobson, I was a friend of your father."     The handshake was firm but there was embarrassment in the face and uncertainty in the eyes.     "Thank you for the letter,"  said Matthew. "It only got to me this morning."       The embarrassment and the uncertainty faded a little and Jack Dobson nodded, "I didn't know if the address was still.."     "No," said Matthew, "I've recently moved."     They stood in silence.       "I never knew my father."  As he spoke Matthew realized that he[CJ16] had totally accepted the fact of his father.     "He had a photograph of you and your wife.  The address was on the back."  Jack Dobson needed to explain.     "What?"  Matthew meant how[CJ17].     "He told me your mother sent it to him when you were married."  Jack Dobson was fumbling in his pocket.  He pulled out a Peterson and dug his finger into the bowl as if seeking solace, or strength.[CJ18]     "1981, she died in  October, I was married in the spring."  So she knew all along, all that time, but said nothing.  Worse, she let him believe his father was dead.  Matthew shook his head.  None of this made sense.  None  of it.     Who were the fat couple?  Matthew turned to look.     "I don't know," said Jack Dobson, correctly interpreting the look and anticipating the question. "I've seen one of them before, a couple of times, in the shop."     "Shop?"       "Your father had a book shop in Camden by the canal."  Jack Dobson sucked and then blew the pipe clear.  He would search for his pouch next.  "He was there for twenty years to my knowledge."     "I lived in Belsize Grove," said Matthew redundantly. "So close."     "Yes,"  Jack Dobson filled the bowl and began the hunt for matches.     "I can't tell you that much about him."  He lit the pipe and inhaled appreciatively.  "But I'll tell you all I can."     "I should be at school," said Matthew, his mind still grasping for certainties to hold onto in this current whirlpool.  "I'm a teacher, history."  He always had to think when he said that.  He had begun his career in an old grammar school in Penzance. Then and there, they were still known as “school masters.”  But not now, not here.     "Anytime," said Jack Dobson, smoking, more relaxed.     "I can ring in," Matthew did not want to wait longer.     "Bus goes by the shop. I expect you'll want to see it."     They turned toward the low hedge and the railed tombs where the lone man, now unbent and taller, watched them go.           They got off by the canal bridge dodging the traffic to cross the road.     "He used to have his name on the window, but it was broken years ago."  Jack Dobson fumbled for the key to the door.  The shop was closed.     "I must have passed here a hundred times," said Matthew.  "The sign above the door just read ‘Antiquarian Books'."     Jack Dobson opened the door.     "He gave me a key to feed the cat when he was away," he said by way of explanation as they went up the stairs.  "He lived above the shop."     The rooms were dark, musty, empty, but the smell was not unfami[CJ19]liar.     "I can make a cup of tea,"  Jack Dobson gestured through the kitchen to the living room.  "There's a phone in there."     Matthew got through, told the secretary he was sick but would be in tomorrow.  Eddie would understand.     "I don't really know where to begin."  Jack Dobson offered Matthew a mug and sat down.  Matthew left the window and sat opposite him.  Jack Dobson lit the gas fire.     "That was his chair."     Matthew half rose, then sat back.  What did it matter?     "When did you meet him?"  he asked.     "I came here in '58, from Liverpool.  I've an antique shop down the road.  Came in here for books and, well, in time we became friends."     "You, er, found him?"     Jack Dobson nodded.  "That lunch time, I'd been to the bank for him."     "Had he been sick?"     "Cancer, but he was in the shop most days - well, less and less since the end of the summer.  He had a girl in to help, Jenny Keen, good lass.  Very upset she is.  Preferred not to be at the burial though.  Do you want to meet her?"     Matthew shook his head, "Later, Mr. Dobson,.."     "Jack."     "When did you find out about me?"     "The night before he died he showed me the photo."  Jack got up and went to the shelf, "He kept it in this book, first edition."  He passed the book to Matthew.     "That's my mother's writing," said Matthew turning the picture over and over in his hands.     "I'll be straight, son," said Jack suddenly. "He didn't want you to know about him. Said it was best."     "You didn't agree."       "No."     "I'm glad.  Thank you," said Matthew.     The last of the uncertainty left Jack.       "He was a good man, your father; private though."     "My mother told me that he died just after I was born. That was 1952.  We moved to Cornwall.  She never spoke of him."     Jack puffed quietly, nodding slowly.     "We lived on a farm, near Penzance. She was a housekeeper, well, in name anyway.  Tom Trelease, the farmer, was like a father to me.  She died in 1981.  By then I had moved to London, married, and I've been teaching at Haverstock School ever since."     "Your father said he'd seen you once; watched your house just after he'd got the photo.  Wanted to know you were alright."     "Did he say why he and my mother.."     "No, never.  I knew he'd been married once, in France."     "My mother was French, lost all her family in the war and came to England.  But she said they were married in England."     Jack shook his head.  "I can't help there. He never said more than I've told you.     "He must have lived here when they were married."     "He never spoke about it.  But he never mentioned living anywhere else so I suppose so."     "Tell me what you can," said Matthew.  "Please."     Jack finished his tea with a grimace, "Gone cold."     Matthew had not touched his.     "Funny.  You know a man, as a friend, for twenty odd years and really you know nothing about him."     "Did you see him often?"     "Not at first. I came in for books, we argued politics, played chess occasionally.  After my wife died we saw more of each other."  Jack went silent for a moment.  "He was lonely I think; me too, then.  I used to come round.  We were company for each other."     Matthew sensed Jack was not saying something.     "Did he have other friends?"     "Not that came here.  He went out sometimes He used to go away to book fairs. That's when he gave me the key, to feed the cat, on weekends."     "Who is Ernst?"  Matthew was thinking of the card and the wreath.     Jack shook his head.     "I never met him."     "You knew of him?"     "Maurice only mentioned him once.  Someone he knew from before the war.  I knew he came here, though."     "And?"     "And, I don't know.  He did come last April. I know that.  He always brought Maurice a few bottles of Schnapps when he came.  That's how I knew.  I asked him about the Schnapps; I'd never seen that particular make before. He said it came from Lunbeck, some local brew.  Filthy stuff.  Not that Maurice was a drinker.  Don't think that."       Jack was quiet for a moment.  Then he stood up took the shop key out of his pocket and put it on the mantle piece.     "Your father sold books.  Wrote a couple too, so he told me, on rare editions or something like that.  We got on, talked about everyday things, the news, local politics, that sort of thing.  We didn't share secrets, nothing deep; it wasn't like that.  It was just everyday things, life as it is.  We accepted each other as we were, no more, no less.  I'm going to miss him."     He went over to the window.     "Jenny will be in again tomorrow, you can meet her then.  I'll give you the address of his bank. They might be able to help you more.  I don't know about the legal situation."   He turned back to Matthew.  "Use that key and look round - you have that right at least.  You'd better have this."  He handed Matthew an envelope.  "It's the Death Certificate; I needed it to arrange the funeral."      "Thank you," said Matthew. "I appreciate what you've done."     Jack shrugged, "You've got my number if, well, if you need it."     "Yes, thanks again."     "I'll let you alone then.  The door sticks so slam it when you leave."     Matthew heard Jack follow his own advice. Then he was alone sitting in his father's chair in his father's flat.  A father he had thought dead for thirty- six years.       The noise of the street came into the room, noticeable now in the silence.  Like a constant  soft roar it washed in through the windows and pushed against the walls.  Now and again it peaked momentarily with a car horn or the hiss of air brakes and then fell back.     This was the sound his father must have heard, perhaps unconsciously, day after day.  These were the walls he looked at.  These - Matthew looked about the room- [CJ20]were his things: fami[CJ21]liar, memory haunted, purposeful with their meaning for that man now dead.  From them, from their presence, he could try to resurrect the man.     "Why not?  I'm a historian; well, I was by training.  So recreate, find Maurice Vigor."  Matthew's voice sounded flat.  "Okay, so it might not work, but I've nothing to lose."     He stood up.     "What do I know?  Not a lot, but more than I did this morning.  Come on.  Detect, construct, look and learn."  He knew that he was speaking aloud because he was uncomfortable; part of him felt that he was intruding.     "Small TV, colour.  Radio, two alcoves of books, shelves on one wall, two comfortable chairs, table, one hard chair, one roll top desk."  He tried the lid.  "Locked.  Cupboards, unlocked, china, cutlery in drawers.  Hmm.  One picture on the wall.  Just the one."  He went over to it. "Oil, original, looks like somewhere in the south of France."  He didn't recognize the signature.  "Small waste bin."  He dug about in the crumpled papers unfolding one of them.     "Dear Matthew,                  I do not know how to begin.......... "     That was all there was.  He pulled out the rest and smoothed them out on the table.       "Four attempts, all no more than the first half line."  The last one was crossed through and something was half drawn, half doodled under the unfinished writing.  He couldn't make it out.  A cup? No, more like a goblet.  And what was that?  A chicken?  An eagle?  Some sort of bird, well, something with wings in a bed of leaves.  He shook his head.     "Looks like you were going to write to me after all, and then changed your mind.  Why?"  He could think of a thousand reasons.  He folded the papers and put them into his pocket.  He walked into the kitchen.     It was tidy, a plate and a knife were on the draining board.  There was some food in the cupboard.  The fridge was a bit thin: milk and some cheese, a collapsed head of lettuce.  He pushed the door shut.  He opened another cupboard.  Tins, glasses, two full bottles of Lunbeckjager Schnapps and an empty one in the kitchen bin.     "Nothing extraordinary."  He wondered what he had expected.     Above him a board creaked and he went cold.  He listened hard.  He heard the traffic again and the hiss of the fire.  The board creaked again and there was a padding sound on the stairs.  Matthew turned.     "Shit."  He said softly as an old ginger cat walked stiffly into the kitchen and rubbed against his leg.  He bent to touch its head, but it backed off slightly.  "You here on your own?"  It meowed softly.  There was dried food on a plate by the door.  Matthew threw it[CJ22] in the bin and taking a tin from the cupboard he rattled about in the drawer for an opener.  The cat waited while Matthew found a clean plate and then ate without further comment.        "So what were you doing up there?"  He climbed the steep stairs.  He opened the first door.     "Bathroom.  Old iron bath, dressing gown, towels, wet razor."  He picked up the brush.  "Pure badger, good quality."  He put it back on the shelf.  "And a tooth brush, still had your own then."  He closed the door and went up three more steps.  The door to the room was ajar.     "Bedroom.  Bloody cold."     The window was open.  "So cat, that's your way in and out."  The window looked out onto a small yard and then to a warehouse wall.  A small ledge just below the window gave access to the cat, and probably to a burglar, he thought.  He turned back to the room.  "Sparse to say the least."     A small double bed.  One wardrobe, a chest of drawers. A hard back chair.  Small table.  There, above the bed, was an icon.  Matthew went closer to look at it.     "Very nice, old by the look of it. The Passion on the Cross, Byzantine?"  But he wasn't sure.  And what's this?"  He picked up the framed photo from the table.  "Silver frame, nice."      Two young men looked out at him.  One sitting, one standing just behind the other with trees and a lake in the background.  He read the inscription.     "To Maurice, Today, Tomorrow, Forever, Ernst."  He looked at it carefully, "So that's what you used to look like.  And that must be Ernst of the wreath."     The faces stared back at him impassively, remote.  He did not know which one was his father.  There was no date.  The frame was sealed.  This was not the time to open it; anyway there might be nothing on the back.  He put it back on the table.     "Well, I know you are still alive Herr Ernst, and what you once looked like and that you did mean forever; well, at least you did keep in touch."     The chest of drawers yielded only clothes and a pair of tortoise shell hair brushes.  He pulled the wardrobe door open.  Just clothes, neatly hung with a smell of mothballs.  Four pairs of shoes, shirts, a shoe box.  Matthew lifted it up.  It tilted heavily and he nearly dropped it.  He put it on the bed raising the lid.  One copy of Rare Books in the Library of Lord Suffolk, by Maurice Vigor, and a pair of cut and stained boots. Something light rattled to the floor. Matthew bent down to pick it up.  It was a Swastika lapel pin, one corner of the enamel chipped away showing the bare metal.  He turned it in his fingers.         He put it back in the box with the boots and book and replaced it in the wardrobe.  There was something else in the corner, black in the shadows.  He pulled it out.  A leather case, unlocked and empty.  A crest was faintly recognizable above the lock.  M.O.[CJ23]D.     "Well, well.  Yours?  Or picked up second hand?"     He put it back.     Downstairs the phone rang.     Just as he lifted it he heard it click as the caller hung up.     It was gone three in the afternoon and the light was beginning to fade.     "Not much more I can do here." He turned off the fire and then he remembered the phone number of the bank that Jack had given him.       He dialed the number.     The manager could see him at eleven tomorrow.     This was more important than the end of term at school. He'd think up a good excuse.  "Any pretense at teaching had finished last week [CJ24]so sod child minding, let the deputy head do something for a change, or get a supply teacher in."       He had decided he was going to be sick tomorrow, too.  Eddie could take a note in for him.         December 21st. 1988.     Matthew was early for the bank and he'd been seated in a corner; the manager would be free soon.  Matthew checked his pockets.  He'd remembered to bring all he thought he'd need.  The death certificate, his own birth certificate and his passport.  He couldn't remember where he'd put his mother's marriage certificate or her death certificate.  Sue would know.  But for the moment he didn't want to see her or let her know anything about what had happened.     Funny, up to a couple of years ago they had shared everything: events, dreams, each other.  Then it had begun to just decay.  Little things at first, unmemorable in themselves but cumulatively poisonous.  Things not said, familiarities forgotten, tolerances retracted.  Then the bickering, the irritations, the growing gap.  It was the distance she kept in bed that he'd first noticed.  He guessed it was typically male to notice the lack of the physical first.  No snuggling, no warmth, then no sex.  After that, downhill all the way.  Separate evenings, weekends she'd spent at her mother's, leaving him alone in the flat. Finally she'd taken a week at the Hen Ho[CJ25]use in Sussex late in August.     "To explore myself and my identity in the company of other women," or something like that she had said, or quoted from the brochure.     He had looked at the brochure but kept his comments to himself.     He didn't think there was anyone else, not that he could be sure; the name Peter had cropped up in a couple of conversations recently.  He could be sure about himself though.  There had been a possiblity at one of Eddie's parties, very possible, but he had not taken advantage.  Not that he hadn't fancied her.  He had. He had just known that he would not be able to handle any complications; well, that was the way he had excused himself at the time.     "Might just as well have," he muttered to himself, "Considering the way it's turning out."     "Pardon?"  The man next to him looked up from his paper, "Did you say something?"     "No, just muttering to myself," said Matthew.     "Don't blame you.  Sat here for an hour last week.  I don't know why they bother to make appointments if they're not going to stick to them."  He shuffled his paper in emphasis and glared in the direction of the manager's door.     Matthew was more fortunate.     "Mr. Vigor?"  The man stepped out of his office, hand extended.     It was quarter past eleven.     "So sorry to keep you waiting.  I'm Mr. Phillips, the manager. Please come in."     The door shut behind them and Matthew sank into the deep leather scented chair while Mr. Phillips took up his position behind a large clear desk.     "Now, how can I help you?"  He smiled helpfully.     "I explained yesterday, on the phone. My father has just died and he has, had, his accounts here."     The smile became sympathetic.  "Do you have the probate form from the solicitors?"     Matthew patiently explained the circumstances.  The manager looked concerned.  Matthew spread out the papers he had brought.  They made little impression.     "This is very difficult."  Mr. Phillips pursed his lips.     "For you or me?"  Matthew could not help the remark, but it was ignored.     "The bank has very strict rules in these cases, Mr. Vigor.  You must understand, there well may be other beneficiaries..."     Matthew listened. What was the point of going over it all again?  He had explained once, but without the necessary forms he knew he was going to get nowhere.     "...What I can do is to give you the address of your late father's solicitors.  They will be able to help you."  Mr. Philips reached for the phone. "They happen to be the solicitors for this bank and that may be of some help in expediting matters."  He spoke quietly on the phone and within minutes a young man appeared with a file.  Mr. Phillips studied it.     "Hmm, the accounts are in credit. There are no current debit or standing orders to attend to," he looked up. "Are there any cheques out?"     Matthew shook his head, "I don't know," he said.     "Of course they will be honoured."  He put the file on the table and scribbled an address  which he passed to Matthew.  "See them. Then we can take things further."     The next phone call augured more success.  He could be seen immediately and their offices were just round the corner.     This time the chair was hard, the desk crowded, the room small and the solicitor a good ten years younger than Matthew.     "I've dug the papers out.  It seems your father was with the firm since he returned to London in June 1951.  We did the conveyancing on the shop."  He looked up, "Long before my time of course, still it's all here.  Now, you've got the death certificate but no will?"     "I, er, haven't found one."     "No, well, it must all be very difficult for you; I understand that.  He doesn't seem to have lodged one with us.  I'm surprised it wasn't recommended." He shuffled through the bits and pieces that had burst out of the string tied bundle.  "No siblings?"     "Not that I know of."     "And you didn't know he was still alive until yesterday?"     "No."     The young man shook his head.       "And you can prove you are his son."  This was not a question.     Matthew passed over his birth certificate and passport.     "Well, Mr. Vigor, we can check with Somerset House for any registrations, and advertise for any claimants to the estate through the usual channels, and apply on your behalf for probate in your favour."     "Is this a lengthy procedure?"     "In such a case, in a word, I’m afraid it could be, yes.  However, we are not insensitive to the problems facing you.  The shop is still trading?"     "I believe he had employed someone to help him in the last few months."  Matthew felt most inadequately informed, but it was all taken in the solicitor's stride.     "I suppose you want to keep it trading?"     Matthew had not really thought about it.  "I suppose so," he said.     "It would seem sensible. We can arrange temporary financing via the bank to trade and pay wages. You'll have to keep strict books though, and no capital release, of course, though any big expenses that are necessary can be referred to us, and I can arrange for your signature to be accepted on the trading account."  He paused for breath, "The less good news is that any personal monies cannot be touched."  He reached for the phone.  "Excuse me a moment."     They waited.     "Mr. Phillips, please.  It's Harry Frank of Lettersby and Gill.  Right.  Mr. Phillips? Harry Frank.  The Vigor account, yes, yes; I'll fax the necessaries..... right... oh, there are, well if it's not cash or valuables then you can.... oh yes, use your discretion or get back to us if in doubt.  Right, thanks."     He hung up.  "Best way with him is not to let him do the talking," he grinned at Matthew.  "It appears there is a deposit box.  If it's just personal stuff you can certainly have it, but as you heard, nothing of value.  Sorry about all this red tape, but I'm sure you can appreciate the possible problems."     Matthew also appreciated that he was being credited with enough common sense not to have them all spelled out to him.     "When you said ‘lengthy,’ quite how long is that?"  Matthew wondered if the question sounded mercenary.     "Six months to a year.  The Probate Court is not renowned for speed, I'm afraid.  Mind you, without complications and if I keep on it; it could be quicker.  Right, let's get the paper work out of the way as fast as we can, and you send me your mother's marriage and death certificates'."     Matthew signed the various forms as they were passed across to him.     "Well, that's it, as long as you're happy for us to represent you we've now done all we can."     Matthew indicated that he was more than happy.     "Good, the Bank will," Mr. Franks looked at the calendar, "I hope, accept your signature from tomorrow morning, but the deposit box has to come up from the Kent storage."     Matthew must have looked slightly puzzled.     "It's not a regular box, one of their sort of 'not wanted on a regular basis type', and with Christmas three days from today I don't think you'll see that until the New Year.  But I'll do what I can.  Where will you be staying?  Above the shop?"     Matthew had not thought about that either.  He had supposed he would be at Eddie's, although Eddie was going up to his family in Scunthorpe for Christmas and Boxing Day.  Sue would probably go home so he might be able to be at the flat.  He still had the keys.  He decided to give all three phone numbers.     "Fine, no problem.  Well, pleased to have met you, Mr. Vigor, and I am sorry to hear about your loss."     They shook hands.      Matthew liked Mr. Franks.     "Damn."  Matthew stopped and looked at his watch, nearly one.  He'd meant to ask Mr. Franks if he knew where his father had come back to London from.  Never mind, he could ring him after lunch.  That would make sense.  Get something to eat and then go to the shop.  He really ought to make himself known to Jenny Keen, especially now.       Mr. Franks had been more than helpful, but he had also swept Matthew along faster than he had intended to be swept.  He was now committed to keeping the shop open and functioning.  What did he know about the book trade?  As Franks would say, "In a word, nothing."  Matthew just hoped that Jenny Keen would want to go on working there and knew what she was doing.     "Oh well, in for a penny, in for a pound."  At least it would mean he would get to find out more about his father.       It had already become a quest, and he had to admit to an increasing curiosity.  Apart from that, it was keeping him from dwelling on the currently less pleasant aspects of his own personal life.       The shop was closed when he arrived.     "Open at 2:30." said the sign.     He unlocked the flat door and pushed, a little too hard and it crashed back against the wall.  He would have to get used to it.       He picked up the two letters and went up to the kitchen.  No sign of the orange cat, but the plate was licked clean.  He went into the living room and put on the fire.  Turning, he knocked over his cup from yesterday spilling cold tea on the thin carpet.     "Bugger."  He fetched a cloth from the kitchen and wrung it out in the sink.       Should he open the letters?  Why not?     One was a junk mail offer, the other a bank statement.     Matthew stared at it.     "Maurice Vigor, Personal Account."  Just one line, "carried forward. £43,045.09."      Matthew read the figure again.       £43,045.09.     "That's a lot of money, a very lot of money,"  he whispered.  "But no withdrawals, no deposits for a month, just the balance.  Not bad at all for a Personal Account.  There must be money in books after all."     He put the statement on the table.  What had the manager said, no current or debit orders.  So there was no monthly rent.  But then the solicitor had said he'd done the conveyancing.  That meant buying.  So the shop and the flat must be paid for.  His father owned this place, and had that much on deposit.  Matthew wondered what the shop account would be like and what other surprises were in store.     "Right desk, your turn."     He looked carefully at the lock.  Solid brass, looked like quality.  There had to be a key.  Where?       Jack hadn't said anything about personal things.  But then his father had died in his bed so he wouldn't have had them on him.  He would have put them where ever he put them at night.  Matthew didn't remember anything in the bedroom.  But then he hadn't actually been looking for specifics.  He went upstairs.  This time he was looking.     The room was just the same.  And just as cold.  He looked around.  Where did people put loose change, wallets, keys?  Matthew usually left them in his trouser pockets, he wasn't a jacket man.  Nor particularly tidy.  His father, if he could judge from the flat was both tidy and a jacket man.  He felt in the pockets in the wardrobe.  Nothing.  Nothing on the side table or the dresser.     "Got you."     Why hadn't he noticed it before.  The table had a drawer.  In fact the whole of the bottom of the table was a drawer.  It slid open easily.  Change in a dish.  Small bunch of keys and a wallet.  Small torch and a copy of the Canto's  of Ezra Pound.     "Hardly bedtime reading," he muttered opening the wallet.     Visa, Mastercard, book of stamps, cards.        'Maurice Vigor.        Antequarian Books'        874,  Camden Avenue, London NW3.           01 446 6787'          "Very tasteful, and fourty five pounds," he'd counted quickly.       Nothing else.  No photos, no notes, nothing personal at all.          The small key fitted the desk and he rolled back the top.           Neat.  Pigeon holes with stationary and envelopes, pens, pencils, a whole box of them, all medium soft and sharpened.  A blotting pad.  A wad of letters.  He flicked quickly throughout them.  As far as he could see they were all to do with books, requests, letters from a publisher, two invitations to book fairs.  He pushed them back and pulled open the drawer.     A file of bank statements.  They confirmed the one he had just opened.  Payments in, appeared to be once a month, probably drawn from the shop account as profits.  A few withdrawals, all smallish amounts.     "Didn't use the account much did you."  He put them back, he could go through them later.  The two cheque books didn't tell him much either. One new the other had only four stubs filled.       That was it.  Not very revealing.     The bottom drawer was full of hospital letters.  He shut it.     He heard a bell tinkle.  The shop.  Time to go down.  He felt nervous but wasn't sure why.  After all he had a right to be here.      "Franks,"  Matthew dialled the number.     He was with a client, the secretary said he would call back, Matthew left the number.     He put the junk mail in the bin, filed the statement and relocked the desk.  He put the keys in his pocket.      He tried the connecting door to the shop from the little hallway, it was locked.  He paused.  No, he would use the street door.  He pulled the flat door shut as quietly as he could and tinkled himself in through the street door of the shop.     A woman was at the desk in the far corner, a phone was jambed between a raised shoulder and her ear while she turned the pages of a book on the desk in front of her.  She was speaking too quietly for him to hear.  He looked round.     A typical old book shop, was his first thought.  Shelves ceiling to floor on all walls, a double line of shelves down the middle.  A reading table near the window with chairs.  A nice touch.  He wandered along the shelves, the topics were neatly labeled.  He crossd to the other wall.       Now these were a little different.  Books on race, books on the Third Reich, books on the theory of Fascism, books on Marxism, books on eugenics, books on heredity.  Title after title.  Many he had never heard of, some he had.  Rosenberg, Chamberlain, Spencer, Darwin, three different editions of Mein Kampf, books on the Holocaust, the SS.  Some in French, some in German, most in English.  This was a very eclecticlly specialist collection.     "Can I help you?"     He turned round.     The woman was standing a few feet away, her face expressionless.  She was not pretty, not immediately.  Her face was thin, elf shaped, her hair long, dark blonde tied back.  She was tallish, about five nine he thought.  Loose jumper, knee lenght beige skirt and small heeled brown shoes.  He took her all in, in one glance, then he smiled.     "Yes, actually, my name is Matthew Vigor."     Her expression did not change.     "Mr. Dobson said you would be calling today,"  her voice was soft but clear.  "I'm sorry about, your father."  There had been the slightest of pauses.     "Thank you," said Matthew.     She pursed her lips fractionally, "How?" She said.     "I'm sorry?" Said Matthew.     "How can I help you?"     Matthew had the distinct impression that she had taken a dislike to him.     "I don't really know," he answered truthfully.  "I didn't know about the shop until yesterday."     "Oh."  Her voice was neutral.     "Nor that I had a father alive."     That did produce a reaction.      Shock, disbelief, uncertainty and then embarrassement narrowed then widened her eyes and brought a colour to her face.     "You thought I was a vulture descending for the pickings?"  He wished he hadn't said that as soon as he had.  "No, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that."     There were sudden tears in her eyes.     "I was very fond of him," she said.     "I never knew him," said Matthew, "But I would like to, like to know what he was like."     This was a difficult conversation.     "Yes,"  she appeared to sense they both needed something to do, something to give them time to adjust.      "I can make a cup of tea," she said.     "Very British," said Matthew and they both smiled at the banality and the necessity of the suggestion.     He had pulled a chair up to the desk and she brought two steaming cups from the tiny cubicle at the very rear of the shop.  He had accepted milk and refused sugar.     "No, it's your desk," he said and she sat behind it, his chair at the side.     From then on it was much easier.     He told her of the solicitor and the decision to keep the shop open.  She was happy to continue running it.  He told her a little of his past and of Frank Dobson's letter.  Her sympathy was genuine.     "I only came here in July," she said, "We got on well, but I didn't know much about him, apart from the books,"  she sipped at the tea.  "When he had bad days, only the last couple of months really, I sometimes did some shopping for him.  But he never spoke about his private life or any family."     "He didn't to Frank Dobson either and he knew him for twenty odd years," said Matthew.     "I always had the feeling he was a very private man,"  she paused.     "And?" prompted Matthew.     "Well, that he was, I don't know, regretting something, hidding something, not that I'm suggesting.."     "It's alright," he interupted her.  Her face had coloured slightly again.  "I think I know what you mean,  there's nothing really personal, nothing just, ordinary, in the flat," he finished lamely.     She nodded, understanding.     They finished their tea.  Two customers came and went, small sales.  She put the money in the drawer and entered the books and the amount in a ledger on the desk.     "I can explain how this all works," she said.     "Later," said Matthew, "If you're happy to run it day to day, see to the stock and that sort of thing I can sign the cheques and pick up what I need to know  as I need to know it."     She nodded, "I have the key to the shop safe, and the paying in books for the bank.  I took my wages in cash this week, it's in the account book."     "That's fine," said Matthew.     She pulled a file from the drawer, "These are the current shop accounts."     They were neat, in his father's hand, and in hers.     The balance was healthy, but not large.     "I found these keys upstairs," he said.     "Flat, shop front, connecting door, safe," she identified them, "I've duplicates of those, this one is the back door to the yard, this one is for the cellar I think and I don't know what that one is."     "That's for a desk upstairs," said Matthew.  "What's in the cellar?"      "I don't know, he only went down there once while I was in the shop."  She paused, thinking, "A man came in with some books for sale."     "Perhaps it's a store?"     "He just took them, didn't unwrap them, I thought it was odd at the time but I didn't ask.  Your father took them down there, he didn't say anything to me."     "Well, let's go and see."  Matthew stood up and tried the key, the door clicked open.     "I better stay, in case someone calls."     "O.K.," he clicked on the light and went down the steep stairs.     The room was large, it extended beyond the shop floor both front and back.  An empty book rack ran across the front wall, empty boxes were stacked tidily in the center of the room.     "Dry as a bone down here," he called up the stairs.     Toward the end wall was another smaller rack.  More books.  Mainly ninteenth century novels, French and English.  He pulled a couple out, first editions and in good condition.  There was a shelf of books on Communism and the USSR.  New books still in their dust covers.  Edition Lutz, he read.  He took down one of them, printed in DDR, but in English, 1954.  He took down a couple more, same printing date.     "Run of political stuff, obviously didn't sell," he wasn't sure if she could hear him.     More boxes, he moved one.  Behind it was a large safe.  Old by the look of it, tall and heavy with a large key plate in the center.  He tried the last key, it didn't fit, that had to be for the back door.      "So where is the key for you?" he asked quietly, "And what's in you?"  That was a key question in more ways than one.  Matthew smiled to himself.  "Secretive old bugger weren't you Maurice.  Well, I've got to call you something, can't keep thinking of you as 'father', too formal, and I can't really call you Dad, can I?"  The books the boxes and the safe sat impassive.  He couldn't see anything else, he went back up stairs leaving on the light.       "Anything?"  Her curiosity was obvious.     "Empty boxes, some novels, shelf of politics, all Lutz Editions from the 50's and a huge locked safe.  You take a look, I'll mind the store."     She hesitated a moment and then nodded.     "Mind the stairs, they're steep," he said as she started down.     He took their cups to the sink, tried the key in the back door after drawing the top and bottom bolts.  It opened onto the small yard he had seen from the bedroom.  Empty apart from a large bin and a dead geranium in a pot.  There was a yard door, he'd check that later.  He came back in relocking and bolting.     She came back up dusting her hands, "Mr Vigor.." she began.     "Him or me?" asked Matthew.     "You," she said, then put out her hand, "Jenny Keen, Jenny."     "Matthew," he said and they both smiled, another hurdle down.     "None of the novels are coded."     "Coded?" said Matthew.     "In the front," she pulled a book from the shelf, "See, letters, they tell me the price it was bought for and the selling price, some have the date they were bought, helps with stock checking.  But those firsts down stairs, none are priced."     "Are they valuable?"     "At first glance, yes, they're a good collection."     "Perhaps they were his, you know, a private collection," said Matthew.     "Perhaps," she nodded.     "What about the Lutz stuff?"     "Cheap political propaganda by the look of it, pretty worthless, I've not see any of those before, but plenty like them, 50p sale junk, or throw out for pulping.  Funny he kept them, he specialised in collectors books on politics, those you were loking at earlier.  Strong stuff some of it, but quite rare, slow sellers but worth having."  She was watching for his reaction.     "And a big safe with no key," said Matthew.     "No sign of the parcel either," said Jenny.     "Perhaps he sorted them one evening."     Jenny nodded.     "No other keys about?"  he asked.     "Not that I've seen, it's too big for the shop."     "Probably the old one before he modernised," said Matthew looking at the small grey safe on the floor by the desk."     He heard a phone ringing.     "In the flat," said Jenny.     "Can I..?" he reached for the phone on the desk.     "No, different number."     "Damn.  I think I know who it is," he pulled the paper from his pocket dropping the crumpled letters as he did so.  "I'll call them back," he dialed as the ringing stopped.     Someone came into the shop, and then a couple more.     "No one, then a rush, typical," said Jenny and left him to the phone.     Franks was as helpful as ever and kept him holding only for a minute.     "Got a pen handy," asked the disembodied voice.     Matthew took a pencil from the tray and scribbled the address on the bottom of one of the crumpled letters.     "27, Rue de la Chat Qui Peche, 9e, Paris," he repeated it back.     "That was just after the war, doubt it's still there, been a lot of redevelopment in that area," said Franks, "Anything else while I'm here?"     There wasn't and both men hung up.     Eventually the shop was empty again.  Jenny returned to the desk and entered the sales.     "If they can't think of anything else, then a book makes a safe present," she said.  "I just wish some of them had a little more idea what they wanted."  She was looking at the paper.     "That's where he was before he came back to London," said Matthew, "He must have gone there just after the war, unless he was in Paris during the occupation."     "Unlikely, he would have been interred as an enemy," said Jenny still looking at the paper.     "They were in the bin," said Matthew, "Looks as if he was trying to write to me just before.."     She put her hand on his arm, momentarily.     "I've seen that before," she said.     "What?"     "That drawing," she pointed to the bird, "It's a Phoenix, see, rising from the flames."     "I thought they were leaves," he said.     "And a chalice, all scribbled through," Jenny looked puzzled.     "Meaning?" he asked.     "I don't know, just, well, people sometimes can't put things in words and doodles or drawings are the nearest way they can express their thoughts."     Matthew looked at her.     "I did a course on unconscious visualisation as part of my degree," she said by way of explanation. "German and English literature, at Sussex."     "So you could sell books?" Matthew smiled at her.     "Not intentionally, but it's been more use here than in my previous jobs.  I really wanted to work for the BBC, programme research.  Some chance, they had over 500 applications for one post last year."     "I'm a history teacher," said Matthew, almost appologetically.     "By choice?"     "Originally," he left it at that.     They were silent for a moment.     "You really want to know about him don't you," she said at last.     Matthew nodded.     "I can understand that," said Jenny, "Both my parents are alive, they live in Sittingbourne, daddie's a dentist."     "Brothers, sisters?"     "Just me, I think they wanted more, but, it didn't happen.  I always wondered why, naturally curious I suppose."     "It's more than that, Tom Trelease was a good man, but I always felt incomplete somehow, pastless if you know what I mean.  No family on my mother's side either."  Matthew rubbed his forhead with his fingers.  Sometimes his feeling of timelessness and placelessness really hurt, though less now than as a child. Then his 'foreigness' and the ambiguity of his mother's position had been bluntly commented on by his peers at the local school.  Children could be very intolerant of outsiders, especially those from a small tightly knit village where everyone knew everyone for generations past.     "Tom Trelease?" querried Jenny.     Matthew explained.  He told Jenny most, though not all, of his past.  He said little about Sue, just that they were no longer together.  He also told her what he had so far discovered about Maurice.  He did not mention the bank statement.     "So this man Ernst must know a lot about him," she said.     "He must do, from even before the war."     "No address book or letters in the desk?"     "Not that I've found so far," said Matthew.     "Just, Ernst, on the wreath."     "Just Ernst," he said, "and the message."     "Which doesn't really help either.  The shop might know," she said suddenly.  "The Hermes logo, that's Interflora," she reached for the Yellow Pages.  "Look, there's four in this area, worth trying them."     Matthew nodded and reached for the phone.     Shop number three came up trumps, they remembered.     "Can you hold?  I'll check the orders," the girl's accent was thick and difficult to follow.     They waited.     "Phoned in," said the girl eventually.     "Is there a number?" asked Matthew.     There appeared to be a discussion going on just out of earshot, then the voice came back.     "I'm sorry we can't give out the number, it's policy."     Jenny took the phone from him, "May I speak to the manager," she said bruskly.  "Hallo, yes, Jenny Keen, Antiquarian World Press, we are doing a report on the funeral of Mr. Vigor.  He was very important in collecting circles and we need a full list of mourners and representatives, my junior has mislaid the full name of Mr. Ernst er, Kunz, or Kien, I can't read the scribble and I need to get the spelling correct.  Your help would be appreciated.  Of course your company will be mentioned as the supplier of wreaths and flowers."     That seemed to do the trick, she scribbled a number and hung up.     "Kunz or Kien?" said Matthew.     "Any name in need," she said looking at the number.  "I don't recognise the code, do you?"     Matthew didn't.     Jenny dialed again, she was passed to International Enquiries.     "Right, thank you," she put down the phone.     "Cape Town," she said, "An hour ahead of us."     Matthew looked at his watch, just after five, give it a try.     Jenny dialed again, he could hear the long wirr wirr of the foreign ringing tone.     It answered.  She explained her request, screwing up her forhead as she tried to follow the fast guteral voice that spoke back to her questions.     "Well, not a great deal of good," she'd put down the phone.  "A flower shop in Konnigstrasse, the order was made personally, by a woman, paid for in cash.  No name or address of the sender was recorded."     "Dead end," said Matthew his excitement at the possibility of a discovery evaporating.     "Well, at least we have a geographic area," said Jenny.     "Now what?"  Matthew looked at her.     She shrugged, "Go through the flat again I suppose, there's got to be something there."          Matthew spent the next hour going through the desk in the flat and generally spooching about, he turned up nothing apart from a stock of various tablets in the back of a cupboard and fifty pounds in a biscuit tin.  The orange cat came in for feeding and then settled in the chair by the unlit fire.  Matthew sat at the desk and drew out a blank unlined sheet of paper, he wrote down all he knew about Maurice so far.  He then made a list of dates in a time line.  Born, 7th November 1917, returned from Paris to London, June 1951, married,?, England or France, died 15.12.89.  Not a lot, but a start.  There were too many questions to be worth writing them down.     He went back down to the shop.  Jenny was in the middle of a last minute rush and Matthew ended up selling his first book.     It was nearly half past five.     "Nothing seems to attract people more than a shop just about to close," said Jenny, "Will you be here tomorrow?"     "I don't know yet, I should be at school, last day of term and all that.     The bell rang and a man came in pushing the door shut behind him.  He came straight up to the desk and stood there, tall, thin, blocking their view of the window and the street.  He put his gloved hands on the desk and bent towards them.     "I vont a bok," he said, his breath unpleasant.     Matthew stood up.     The man was still taller than him, the large gloved hands reluctantly swung back to his sides.     "You have this bok."  It was not a question.     "What title?" asked Jenny.     "Chasseur d'Amour, published Reims, 1630."     "No," said Jenny, I'm sorry, I do not have that title."     "You haf not looked."  His voice and manner sought to intimidate.     "I do not need to look, I know my stock."  Jenny was not intimidated.     "The shop has a new owner, perhaps also new stock."     "We do not have that book,"  Matthew came from the side of the desk, the man did not move.       "If you leave your name and address, we can try to locate it for you."  Jenny pulled a pad towards her.     "Locate?"       "Do a book search, try catalogues," she said.     "Find it, yes, it is better you find it, soon."     "Your name and address?"     "No, I vill come back."  He turned and left.     Matthew followed him to the door, locked it and turned the closed sign.     "That is what I call rude," said Jenny. "And how did he know, about Mr. Vigor?"     "I don't know," said Matthew.  "But he was familiar, something about him, the way he stood.  I've seen him before, recently."                                   27th. December 1988.     Matthew knew it was fairly late in the morning.  The weak sun was doing its best to penetrate the curtains in Eddie's spare room and it threw a pinkish glow over the debris of last night's Chinese take away.  He inched open a crack in the sleeping bag.  The room was cooling rapidly, the central heating was still on term time.  If he didn't get up soon he probably wouldn't.  He sat up and still cacooned dumped his legs on the floor clinking the empty wine bottle against the glass.     "What a shit hole," he grunted.  His head thumped and his throat felt like the inside of an old London water pipe.       His clothes lay where he had dropped them, books and magazines were scattered like hippy cushions and the TV hissed off channel as the video had rewound.     "So much for Christmas."  He masochistically let the sleeping bag slip to his waist and then stepped out of it.  "Hardly Venus rising from the waves."       He looked at himself in the mirror, "Body okay., but the face looks rough."     He switched the heating on and went into the shower.     Washed, shaved and coffeed he felt better.  Cleaning up didn't take that long either.  He put the video tapes by the door.     "Crap, crap, and reasonable.  But no way am I paying for an extra day on any of you."  He'd drop them in on the way to the shop.     He knew he was going to the shop today, not that he had consciously decided it.  He was just going.  It was officially shut until the second.  Jenny was with her parents in Sittingbourne, she had left her number.  He wasn't sure why, there was hardly likely to be a sudden crisis in the book trade.     The smell of burning toast drew him back into the kitchen.  He put fresh bread under the grill and sat to watch it this time.  Eddie would be back from his sister's in Scunthorpe tomorrow and it was time he moved out.  Not that Eddie had said anything, but this was supposed to be temporary.     He looked at the case he had brought back from the flat.  What a way to spend Christmas day, breaking and entering.  Not that he had.  He still had a key and the title to be there, but it had felt alien and uncomfortable.  What had surprised him was how quickly Sue had removed as much of his presence from their flat as she could.  He had found most of his clothes, personal papers, and obvious possessions in the box room.  Books and records had not been moved, but then they weren't obvious in that personal way.   He'd go back for them another time.     Then there had been the note.               I have seen the solicitor, I want a divorce.  We’ve talked about it long enough.       You'll be hearing from them soon.  There's no point in this charade or in further  discussion. Sue.     Not even a "Merry Christmas."     She had known he would come back while she was away.  Did all women alone go to their parents for Christmas?  He supposed most people did, not just women.  Well, those who had parents anyway.  Even Jack Dodson, last seen at the shop on Christmas Eve just to see if there was anything he could do, had gone to spend a couple of days with some distant relations.  Matthew reckoned that half the country must spend the day in the other half's house.     "Haven't seen them for years, but now Maurice is gone..."  He'd left the rest unsaid, his loneliness apparent.     The toast beckoned.     "Ah well, at least I've found the papers Harry Frank needs.  Fuck it!"  He'd now got marmalade on his trousers, he bent to pick up the fallen knife.  It was going to be one of those days.           He managed to open the door without clouting the wall; he was getting the hang of it.  He dumped the case in the living room.  The orange cat opened an eye and then closed it again.  Someone was getting used to him being there.  He lit the fire and the cat moved out of the chair to lie belly forward to the flames.     Matthew was pleased it was at home. Company.  He sat in the chair, legs out.  The traffic was muted, the streets quiet after the festive excesses.     He would stay here.  Not so much a decision as an obvious solution until things were clearer.  He could make a bed out of the cushions.  He couldn't use the bedroom, not yet.  Too soon,  too much, too cold.      He had passed Sainsbury's on the way over; he'd go shopping later.  Then potter about in the shop, read, watch TV.  There wasn't a videoplayer; he might get one.     He got up and poured himself a glass of schnapps, sipped it and poured it back.     "Bloody hell!  That's evil."     He dug about in the cupboard.  There was a couple of fingers of scotch left in a bottle.     "That's more like it," he went back to his chair.     "I can't see you going back to teaching old son, not now."  He pulled the other chair closer and rested his feet on the seat.  "And if they don't like it, tough.  Tired, emotional, stressed should be able to swing a certificate on that."       Dr. Hamilton was an understanding and sympathetic man and he had known Matthew since he had come to London.  He'd last seen him at the beginning of the autumn term.  Nothing serious.  Not sleeping well, indigestion, general feeling of the pointlessness of what he was doing.     "And Christ, it couldn't get much more pointless."     The end of term exams!  Even when he told them the questions they still got them wrong.  Not that it was really the kids fault.  What was the point of learning?  There were no jobs to go to with or without qualifications.  But it went deeper than that. It was the whole structure of the education system.  Right from the top.  Change for changes sake, new initiatives, a proliferation of acromyms to cover endless committees to generate endless paperwork and no money for books.  He didn't even teach history anymore.  Now it was Combined Humanities and totally devoid of any real method or content.  And as for Staff Training Day, that was a laugh.     He finished the scotch.     "I tell you cat, the last day of term would have made you laugh.  Half the kids didn't turn up despite the Head's dire threats about phoning home to check up on them made at every assembly last week.  Most of the books that were out haven't come back and the reports have been held over until next term.And what do we spend the afternoon doing?  Rounding up the sixth form who'd been to the pub at lunch time and trying to stop last years leavers from crashing the junior forms disco.  You can't keep them at school when they should be there and you can't keep them away when they've left.  Should have sent them all home before lunch.  But no, that would be too easy a solution.  Bloody administrators."     The cat ignored his diatribe and Matthew fell silent.  Funny, a lot had begun to clarify in the last few days.  Somewhere in his corner of life a door had opened all because in the life of the man that had been his father, a final door had closed.     "Time for shopping; list-less and free I shall raid the cornucopia of capitalism's bounty.  And old fur face, do you have any preferances? No?  Then Whiskers it shall be."     Sainsbury's was surprisingly busy and Matthew had to wait for some time at the check out.  At last, bebagged and poorer, he staggered out into the foyer.  No way would he find a cab nor get this lot on a bus for one stop.  He would just have to walk back and hope his arms didn't get pulled out.     "Bloody cat food, costs a fortune and weighs a ton."     "But they're worth it ,love, especially when you're on your own."  The old lady parking her trolly next to him smiled, "I've got three of them, wouldn't be without them for the world."     From the look of her bag that was all she had bought.  Perhaps she ate cat food, too, he thought and smiled back at her.     The moment Matthew returned to the shop he knew something was wrong.  He checked the flat, kitchen and living room.   He went upstairs, bathroom and bedroom.  Nothing.  He looked out into the yard.  The back gate was half off its hinges.  The shop, the back door!     He raced down the stairs and fought with the connecting door, got through it and flicked on the lights.  Empty.  The back door. It was still there but the lock bulged in as if something very heavy had been hammered against it.  Luckily both the top and bottom bolts had held.  As the adrenalin began to subside the shop alarm went off like a beserk bellringer.  Matthew hunted for the switch, but he needed the key.  Where was it?  Back of the left drawer, no, right drawer?  He groped about.     "Oh where the fucking hell has she put it!"  The noise was driving him mad.  He dropped the drawer and papers scattered round his feet.  He dragged the next one out and he saw the key bounce into hiding between the safe and the wall.  He could see it but not reach it.       "Ruler, ruler."     There was one on the desk.  Not long enough.  Something under the little sink in the back?     Nothing.     There was a wooden box, brass corners, one missing.  He pulled it out and opened it.  A tool box.     "Praise Allah, the Merciful."  There was a coil of wire in the top compartment.     He fished about and finally hooked the key.     Silence. At last, except for the wringing in his ears.  And the knocking.  He looked up.  Figures moved in front of the shop window and a blue light flicked round and round on top of the car jerking their shadows against the glass.         He went up to the door.     "It's alright, I've found the key." He said through the glass.     "Open the door."     Matthew slid the bolts.     Keys.  They were still in the connecting door.  He gestured and retrieved them.      Both officers crowded in standing close to him.     "This your shop sir?" said the older one.     "No, er yes," said Matthew still flustered, "I forgot the alarm."     "So we heard."  The older one again.     "Bit of a mess."  The younger one was looking at the drawers and the papers.     "Can you prove it sir?"  The older one, his radio cracked and he turned it down.     "Are you alone sir?"  The younger one.     "Yes," said Matthew.     "Right then, shall we?"  The older one gestured toward the back of the shop.     The younger one closed the door and locked it keeping hold of the keys.  They processed to the desk.     "I came back from the shops, thought something was wrong, came to investigate and set the alarm off."  Matthew was beginning to recover his composure.     "And you are?"     "Matthew Vigor," said Matthew.       "The key holder is a Maurice Vigor," said the younger one.     "My late father," said Matthew and began on the full explanation.     They heard him out without interruption.     "And can you prove this sir?" asked the older one making notes as he spoke.     Now that was actually going to be difficult.  Possessing the keys and being in the flat and shop could be interpreted either way.  All three of them knew that.  What useful papers he had were with Franks and he was on holiday, as, thought Matthew, was everyone else.       "You could ring my manager, Jenny Keen," he said at last.     Neither man looked impressed by that suggestion.     The phone rang making Matthew jump.  The officers looked at each other, the younger raised his eyebrows.     Matthew picked up the phone.     "Mr. Vigor, it's Martin's Bank," said the voice.     "Yes," said Matthew, "It's my bank," he said to the officers, his hand over the mouthpiece.     "May I talk to them?"  The older had his hand out.     "Could you hold please," he passed the phone over.     The conversation would have been comical if it had not been so serious.  Eventually the officer hung up, then picked up the phone book, checked the number and called back.  Finally satisfied he let Matthew take the message.  The deed box would be available for him to inspect on the 2nd at 10 am.          The younger, once certain Matthew was who he said he was, had been inspecting the door.     "Looks like a crude sledge job," he said drawing the bolts.     The door opened with a shudder.  The exterior lock plate was bruised from concentrated blows, some of the wood was splintered.     "Lucky they were long bolts,"  the older slid them too and fro.       "Nothing in the yard.  Back gate's a mess.  You can probably block it with the bin," called the younger.     The older was on his radio.  Finishing, he turned to Matthew.       "Do you keep cash on the premises?"     "Petty cash, the rest is banked."     "And you were certain this had not happened before you went out?"     Matthew was not certain, but he was pretty sure.     "You said you brought a case over with you this morning."  The older was still making notes.     "Just clothes and a few papers," said Matthew, "Nothing valuable."     "They wouldn't know that."     "They?"  said Matthew.     "Well, it's possible someone was watching you, or the shop.  You can get up into the flat from here."     Matthew nodded.     "So coming in the back way makes more sense than going through the front."     "But the alarm?"     "Sledge hammers don't do them a lot of good either," said the younger.     "Right then, sir, we'll be off. Scenes of Crime will be along soon to try for prints, then I'd get a locksmith to fix that door."  The older's radio crackled again.     And then they were gone, leaving Matthew with the keys in his hand and a most definite sense of unease.     He fixed the yard door with the bin and did what he could with the back door making sure he didn't touch anything other than the inside bolts.     He replaced the drawers and the papers.  He'd have to sort something out with the alarm, one key in the drawer was no good, unless Jenny had another key.  He made a mental note to ask her.     He pushed the tool box back under the sink and there, hanging on a wire up under the bowl, was a key on a ring well out of sight unless, as Matthew currently was, you were on hands and knees.     "Well, well.  Three guesses what you might fit," he said.     He was right in one.  The key slid easily into the safe's lock and turned stiffly.  The door didn't open, he stared at it.  The key fitted and turned so why didn't it open?  He turned it back.  Nothing.  He turned it forward and then again.  It turned another full revolution and he heard the inner bolts click back.  The door pulled heavily open.     "Papers!"     Jammed full of them.  Disappointment.     He pulled them out.  Old catalogues, wads of them.  He looked at the covers.       'M. Vigor, bibliophile antequarian.      27, Rue de la Chat Qui Peche, 9e. Paris.      Octobre 1948.'      There were catalogues running from Printemps 1946 to Ete 1949. He stacked them by his side.      He dug further.  A manila file.  Address lists and names.  He flipped through, Belgium, France, Holland, Norway, Spain, USA.     "Very international," he closed the file and put it on top of the catalogues.  "That it?"     At the bottom under a sort of shelf was a flat box.  He pulled it out and took off the cardboard lid.  Three books.  New, still in cellophane wrappers.  No titles.     He tore the cellophane from the first one.  Even Matthew could recognise that these were very expensively produced.  He turned the first page and the second.  No printer, no date, but the title was clear.     The Rape of Joy.  Beautiful lettering.      He turned the next page and froze.      The photograph was exquisite.  Black and white, posed, charming in its simplicity, potent in its promise.  The girl, six or seven, no more, looked innocently back at him.  Her eyes alive, her delicate features forming a half Madonna smile.     He didn't want to turn the next page.     Or the next, or the next.     He put the book down, ran up the stairs and was sick in the little sink.     "Oh Christ !  No, no, no, no, no."     He ran the tap and wiped his face.     His heart thumped; his palms dripped.     Not that, please, not that.   Anything but that.  His father!     Where they for personal use?  Or for sale?  Either way was beyond acceptance.     He sat at the desk.  Pornography was one thing, but children?  That explicit?  And it was real, even down to the photos of her corpse on the last three pages.       He felt himself shaking and he could not stop.  Is that where the private bank balance came from?     Revulsion, panic, hate, blind hate surged within him.  What animals?  No, not animals.  Worse, what people made these?  What people wanted them?          The knocking intruded.  Persistant.  Someone was calling his name.  He stood up.  A man and a woman were at the door.  He went toward them.     "Mr. Vigor, Scenes of Crime."  They were both holding ID's for him to see.     He unlocked the door; they came in.     The man walked to the back of the shop.  The woman took his arm.     "It can be very distressing sir," she guided him to the chair.  "But at least they didn't get in."     He nodded and said something.     "Cup of tea?" she was smiling sympathetically.     "Oh, yes of course," he stood up.     "No, sir, for you, I can make it."  He sat down again, confused.     She fussed round at the sink while her companion dusted and photographed.     He drank the tea, unthinking, sweet and strong.  She was talking to him, soothing.     "You can get the lock done now."  The man had closed his case.     "Pardon?" said Matthew.     "Do you have a locksmith?"  The woman put her hand on his arm again.     Matthew shook his head.     She pulled the Yellow Pages towards him.     "If you'll chose one sir."     The large ad said 24 hour emergency, he pointed to it.     She lifted the phone and called.     "Here in an hour.  Are you alone sir?"     "Yes, yes, but I'll be alright, really, thank you."  The enormity of the shock was subsiding.     "Right then, next call."  The man was obviously in a hurry.     Matthew looked up at him.     "Clumsy job, five pound long handle sledge by the look of it.  Would have worked but for the bolts - must have been disturbed though or they would have given if he'd had long enough."     "You need steel doors and frames these days," the woman looked around.  "Not the usual target, a book shop."     Matthew nodded, "No," he said.     They left.     He went back into the cellar.  He had to look.  The other two books were similar.  A boy and a boy and girl, parodies of adults.  He put them back into the box, pushed it under the shelf and then piled the catalogues and file back into the safe.  He slammed the door and locked it.  He nearly threw the key across the room.     "Think first," he said to himself.  "Incinerator and as soon as possible."  He put the key in his pocket.  He didn't want anyone else finding what he had found.               2nd.January 1989.     The Surgery was crowded - colds, flues and malingerers.  Did he fall into the the last catagory?  He hadn't slept well since he'd found those damn books.  He was also worried by the growing suspicion that he was being watched.  Mind you, that could be the result of not getting enough sleep.  Then there was the timimg of the attempted break in; that was in itself suspicious.  Matthew was also convinced that the man who'd called at the shop, the one with the breath and the accent was the same man he'd seen at the cemetery.  First in the distance and then by the tombs. The realisation had come to him about three a.m. yesterday morning.  Or was it the morning before?  Anyway, the more he thought about it, the more convinced he was.      His appointment was for ten past nine, if he got in on time he would still make the bank by ten.  Talk about tight scheduling.     He couldn't be bothered to look at magazines.  He just sat there staring ahead, seeing those pictures of the girl and wondering who she had been and what she had suffered.     "Matthew Vigor, room 4," squarked the box in the corner.     He got up and went in.     Dr. Hamilton heard Matthew's symptoms without comment.  Then while he listened to Matthew's chest and took his blood pressure he asked where he was staying and if he was eating regularly.     "Well, physically you're fine," Dr. Hamilton sat back at his desk while Matthew dressed.  "Are you sure staying above the shop isn't worrying you?"     Matthew said it wasn't; on the contrary, he felt better there than at Eddie's.     Matthew had not mentioned the books.    "And have you seen a solicitor?  You're going to need one if Susan goes ahead with divorce proceedings."    Matthew said he had.    Dr. Hamilton finished writing.    "No more than four a day; they're a mild sedative.  Come back in two weeks and we'll see how you are then."  He handed Matthew a certificate and smiled his encouragement.    Matthew was at the bank by just after ten.  The girl at enquiries buzzed him into a room and a security guard took him through another door to the vault room.  The undermanager was waiting for them, a stubby, numbered, oblong box lay on the table.     "This is not a valuables box, Mr. Vigor," he said.  "It is solely used to hold papers and documents of a private nature."     "I understand," said Matthew.  It had all been explained to him when he had rung back to the bank the day after they had called him, to say he could find no deposit box key.     "The bank holds the only key but a record is kept of its opening."  The undermanager put a book in front of him, "If you would sign here, I will date and initial it."     Matthew noted that the last date by his father's signature was November last year.  He only just caught the year of the previous date before the book was shut.  It was 1952.     The undermanager lent forward, inserted a small key, turned it,and the lid snapped up half an inch.     "I am sorry, but under the, er, cicumstances, I must be present and record the contents."  The undermanager was trying to be as polite about it as he could.     Matthew nodded and, praying there was nothing there that was obscene or incriminating, opened the lid fully.  He took out the articles laying them on the desk.    'A set of black covered quarto journals dated from January 1936 to December 1951.  A single red covered quarto journal, undated.'     Matthew waited until the undermanager finished writing before he continued.     'A yellow oilskin packet...,'     The undermanager stoped recording and looked at Matthew who began to unwind the wire.     '...Containing various papers and diagrams.'     Matthew lifted out the flat leather box and opened it.  Both men gave a slight gasp.     'An ornamental dagger, in a leather case, on silk, Nazi design.'     Matthew picked it up, turned it in his hand and quickly replaced it in the case.  Only he had seen the initials 'MV' on the blade.     "Strictly speaking that should not have been deposited in this box," the undermanager was not too pleased by this discovery.     'A book, title,'      He wrote as Matthew spelled it out in a slightly strangled voice.     'Chasseur d'Amour, Reims, 1630.'     The box was now empty.     The undermanager closed the notebook after Matthew had signed his agreement to the contents.     "Under bank policy, I cannot release either the dagger or the book to you until we have the Probate or proper authority to do so.  However, the journals and papers are personal and of no value and so may be released."     The undermanager took paper from the table drawer.  If you would sign to say that you have taken custody of them."  He quickly listed the journals and yellow packet, "And that you will not destroy or otherwise dispose of them until permitted to do so."     "By Probate or proper authority," finished Matthew who wanted to get out of the room and the bank and away from this man as quickly as possible.     The undermanager nodded.     Matthew wished he had thought to bring a bag with him and looked around to see if there was anything in the room.     "Perhaps I can find something for you," the undermanager said relocking the box.     In the street, the journals and papers hidden in the provided plastic carrier bag, Matthew hailed a cab and collapsed back into the seat.     "I can't take much more of this," he said to himself.     "What was that guv?"  The driver turned his head toward the part open divider.       "Nothing," said Matthew, "Look, drop me up by the Oxford Arms, will you?  Same road, but by the lights."     "I know it," said the driver. "Nice little theatre upstairs.  Have you been there?"     Matthew didn't reply, he was too busy thinking.     He continued thinking while he nursed a half of best bitter.  It wasn't the drink he'd come in for - he just didn't want to go straight up to the flat, nor to talk to Jenny.  Well, not yet anyway, though he had to admit he was looking forward to seeing her again.       How did the dagger have MV on the blade.     He was trying to avoid thinking about that.  First paedophilic snuff books, now a personalised Nazi dagger.  What next for Christ's sake.  Had he been a concentration camp guard?  Did his mother know about all this?  Is that why he had died as far as she was concerned?     And don't forget the book.     Okay, take it step by step.  The book.  Someone had come in wanting, no, demanding the Chasseur.  The book was in a deposit box.  The box had last been opened in November.  Had the book been put in then?  Most probably.  The caller had ordered the book?  Paid for it? No, most likely ordered it.  Maurice had found it for him but for some reason didn't want him to have it.  Perhaps it was valuable and he could get a better price.  That was likely.  In fact that was a very reasonable explanation.  The other possibility?  The book had been there since 1952 and the man was still after it?  No, too improbable.     Right, that was one out of three solved.     Those other books.  Not enough information to compute, unless for personal use or private sale.  Both possible, however distasteful.  Still, destroy them and that was the end of it.  The dagger?  Curio?  Not unless MV was German for something and not initials.  Unless of course it was a gift, something to do with friendship, something to do with the South African/German Ernst, the schnapps bringer.  Something from before the war.  Hardly a gift to give to anyone after the war, surely?     Matthew finished the half.  Two and a bit out of three.  Good enough.  Time now to see what was in the journals and papers and talk to Jenny and explain the half new back door.      "So, you won't be going back to school for the next fortnight?"     Matthew thought Jenny looked quite pleased.  She read his expression.     "January is the deadest month, oh, I'm sorry."  She put her hand to her mouth in embarrassment.     "It's alright," he said.  "The deadest month for what?"     "Bookselling," she said   Bad weather, few browsers, people spending only on sales and necessities."     "Perhaps we should have a sale, get rid of those pulp politics in the basement."     "Not a bad idea," she said  There are a few slow movers on the shelves that could join them.  You might want to get some hardbacks of popular modern novels and mark them below paperbacks.  I know some warehouses that sell remaindered stock from stores left with hardbacks after the paperbacks come out."     "Well, look into it, you're the manager."  he grinned at her and was rewarded with a smile.  "You did German didn't you?"     "Yes, I'm not fluent, but close."     "Do the initials 'MV' mean anything in German, say Post Weimar, pre Second World War?"     Jenny creased her forehead.  "I don't think so.  The Nazi's loved initials and acronyms, but 'MV', no."  She shook her head in emphasis.  "I can check it though; I've some specialist texts at home."     It was his turn to raise an eyebrow.     "Nazi literature, and I use the term lightly, was an area I was interested in at University.  That and European post-war right-wing movements.  That was one of the reasons your father employed me.  He spoke fluent German and you saw some of the books he sold.  I think he was interested in that area, too, though more in the politics than general writing."     Matthew just nodded.     "Question number two.  Do you remember that caller before Christmas who demanded we find him a book?"     "The tall man with the black gloves?"     "That's the one.  He was after the Chasseur d'Amour, Reims, 1630," said Matthew.     "Impressive memory.  You'll make a bookseller yet."  Her smile faded as she saw that Matthew was looking serious.  "I'm sorry, I should have checked on that at the time. He did say he would be back."     "Is it a valuable title?"       "I don't know."  She stood up and went to the shelf behind the desk and began to look along the titles.  "Booksellers references," she said by way of explanation.  "Right, if it's in this one it is."      It wasn't.  She returned to the shelf.            Matthew could tell from her body language that she was annoyed with herself for not having done this before.     A good ten minutes passed.     "Got it."  She brought a book to the table, "You'll have to help; my French is a bit rusty.     "No problem," said Matthew.       They bent over the text.     "An erotic pillow book, known for its detailed plates by Cassier, considered daring in its day, banned by the Roman Catholic Church and still on the Prohibited list.  A collector's item for content rather than rarity. In good condition, 4000 francs."  Matthew looked up from reading.  "What date was this written?"     Jenny turned to the front of the book.  "1967," she said.     "So it's not likely to be worth much more now."     "I shouldn't think so.  To a collector of erotica you might get a few pounds more. Why?  Have you found a copy?"     "Not exactly," said Matthew.  "I went to the bank this morning.  Maurice had some things in a deposit box. That was one of them, but they didn't let me have it."         "He had a copy?"  She was puzzled. "At the bank?"     "He put it there in November."     "He didn't say anything to me."     "Perhaps the man called first when you were out, or telephoned," said Matthew.     "But why put it in the bank?  It doesn't make any sense."     "No," said Matthew agreeing.     "If he calls again?"     "Well, we still haven't got it have we?"  He wished the book had been valuable, that would have explained everything.        "You don't think..." she didn't finish her thought.     "The door?  No, that's too bizzare."     They both sat, silent, thinking.            "I think I'll sort out some sale titles," said Jenny at last, "and earn my wages."     Matthew took over the desk.  He took the yellow packet from the carrier bag and removed the rest of the wrapping.  Some of the sheets had fallen out into the bag, he retrieved them.  They were pages from a laboratory notebook whose broken spine had released them from its hold.  He shuffled through them.  A cramped hand had covered them with figures, calculations and small spidery diagrams.  He unfolded the two large sheets careful of the creases which threatened to tear.     The diagram looked like a blueprint for Snowdon's Aviary in Regent's Park.  He refolded them, none the wiser.     He read the name on the notebook cover.     'Eric Simms, Kings, Cambridge.'     Someone Maurice knew? Or just something he had picked up somewhere?  It must have meant something or why put it in the bank?       He took out one of the journals and opened it.  Small writing in faded pencil - Maurice's?  Certainly different to the notebook and written in German.  Jenny could help here.  If it was his father's private writings.   Did he want her to read it?      Matthew thought about the books downstairs in the safe, and about the dagger.       The journals covered 1936 to 1951.  A long time ago.  Did it matter what was in them?  Yes, it could.  It was his father who had written them.  A father he had never known, a biological father only.  Jenny had known him, albeit only for a few months and she had liked him.  He pulled another from the bag.  A photo fell to the floor.  He picked it up.     Two men, naked, sprawled on the grass looking up at the camera.  There were a couple of tennis racquets and the bottom three courses of a flight of brick steps.  He turned the photo over.     The same small writting, 'Maddingly, July 1942'.     Matthew looked back at the men.  Was one of them Maurice?  Who was the other man?     "Maddingly?" called Matthew.     "Near Cambridge," answered Jenny from behind a shelf.     Matthew picked up the phone and dialled directory enquiries.     This would not do the phone bill any good.  He should have at least waited until after one.  He hung on, this would be the fourth person he had spoken to. Of course, most of the staff were still well on holiday as had been repeatedly explained to him.  The line clicked, number five answered.     "Sorry you've been shunted round a bit," said the voice.  "You want to know about a Dr.Eric Simms, I gather."     Matthew said he did.     "Then the man you want is Dr. Charles Lester  He's been working on the University's war time research for years and if your man was one of ours and was here then, he'll know all about him."     Eureka, thought Matthew, then asked, "I suppose he's still on holiday?"         The speaker laughed.  "Not unless someone got him out with a crowbar.  I don't think old Lester's ever had a holiday.  No he'll be at home, or in his rooms."     "Do you have a number for him?"     "Never answers his phone, but I've got it here for what it's worth."     Matthew scribbled both numbers on the pad.     "Do you have an address?  I could write."     "Somewhere in Leys Road..., hang on, 147..., don't know the post code."     Matthew thanked him and hung up.     Well, that was a start.  If the other man in the photo was Simms, and that was a strong possibility, then at least he may be able to find some more about Maurice via knowing about Simms.  Worth a try.     The door bell rang and a woman came in looking around, unsure.  She came over to Matthew and pulled a brown paper bag from her coat pocket.     "Do you buy books?" she asked.     "That depends," answered Matthew.  "Jenny, could you deal with this please?"     Jenny came over and drew the woman aside.     Matthew tidied the notes on the desk and put them into a strong brown envelope consigning the yellow wrappings to the bin.  He flipped through the other journals, all in German and no more photos.     The door bell rang again and he looked up.  Jenny came over to him.     "Third edition Dicken's in kit form," she said.  "Pity, the woman looked as if she could do with some money."     Matthew nodded.     Jenny was looking at the journals.     "Rest of the deposit box; I think they are diaries of some sort, but all I can read are the dates."     She crinkled her forehead.     "They are in German," he said.  "Look, I wondered if...," he hesitated.     "If I'd translate them?"     "Yes, and no. Read them and give me the gist, but..,"     "But?"     "Some of it might be, well," Matthew struggled for the word.     "Personal?" she volunteered.     "Extremely."  He wanted to say something about the books in the safe, she may even have a militating explanation.     "I think I can handle that, if you can," she answered perceptively.     He showed her the photo.     I think that's Maurice and another man who was at Kings called Eric Simms. Someone there knows about him," he said.     "Nice tan by the look of it; good body too."  She handed the photo back.  "I can try it between customers," she said.     He handed her the first journal.  "I'm going to try this Lester fellow who I'm told doesn't answer the phone."     It answered on the second ring.     "Hallo," it was a woman's voice.     "I'm trying to contact Dr. Lester," said Matthew.      "Uncle Charles, phone!"  Matthew held the phone away from his ear, the voice was piercing.  "Phone!" He looked at Jenny. "He should hear that," he said.     "Lester," the tone was curt.     Matthew quickly explained his call.     "And you have some papers of Dr. Simms?"  The question was eager, the tone now most ameniable.     Matthew described them briefly.     "This is wonderful, wonderful.  And where are you?"     "London," said Matthew.     "Could you send them to me, or bring them down?   Yes, bring them and I can tell you what I know.  This is really most exciting, most exciting.  You can't imagine, a note book and diagrams."     Matthew confirmed there were both.     "It's only an hour from Liverpool Street.  Frequent trains. Could you come this afternoon?"     Both men must have looked at their watches simultaneously.  It was nearly four.     "Ah, no, perhaps in the morning?"     "Yes, tomorrow morning, what time?"     "Ten, my rooms at college.  The porter will show you."     So it was agreed.     Matthew hung up.  "I think I've just offered him a late Christmas present," he said.     The train was empty and fast and due into Cambridge in five minutes.  The brown envelope with the Simms notes was in the briefcase Matthew had found in the wardrobe.  Older than the one he used for school, but in much better condition.  It had come up quite well with a quick polish.  Jenny was in the shop with the first journal and Matthew had put the others on the shelf in the living room.  He folded his paper.  The train was slowing.     He paid the taxi and approached the porter's lodge.  The sky was iron grey and a cold wind whipped up scraps of paper and blew them suggestively against his legs.     "That's his room, sir," the porter retreated and Matthew knocked.      The door flew open.     "Mr. Vigor, right on time, come in, come in."  Dr. Charles Lester must have studied the archetype for Cambridge dons and had been more than successful with his imitation.  He was about 50, balding, glasses pushed up on his forehead, a rumpled cord jacket and creased trousers echoed the general chaos of the room.  Books and papers crowded desk, chairs and floor.  Three coffee cups loitered dangerously on the mantlepiece in close proximaty to an empty gin bottle and an overflowing ash tray.     "Please, sit," Dr. Lester swept files to the floor and pulled a chair toward the desk.  He himself perched on the edge and precipitated a small avalanche of books across the blotter.     "You've brought them with you?"     Matthew undid the case and passed the envelope over.     A clock, half an hour slow ticked in the silence while Dr. Lester poured over the notes and then spread out the diagrams.  For an untidy man in a crowded space he was precise and delicate in his handling of the sources.     "I cannot begin to explain how important these are,"  Dr. Lester pushed up his glasses to look at Matthew. "How did you come to have them?"     Matthew explained the essentials while Dr. Lester nodded and beamed at him.     "Well I doubt I can help you as much as you have helped me, but I will try."  He put the notes and diagrams back into the envelope and sat behind his desk.  "What do you know about special weapons research in the Second World War?"     "Nothing," said Matthew truthfully.     Dr. Lester looked disappointed and then lent back and folded his arms.     "Even before the outbreak of war, Britain, along with Germany and Japan, although we were ahead in the research field despite Government parsimony, were looking at new ways of waging war.  Radar and Asdec are good examples."     Matthew nodded.     "Obviously there were specialist research establishments, but most of the brains, if I can put it that way, were in the universities.  Once war began they were pulled into the war effort, not always willingly I might add.  However, if one wanted funds for research, then he who pays the piper calls the tune."     Dr. Lester waved at the piles of papers.       "This little lot is about a tenth of the bumpf generated by such research.  Most of it went nowhere.  Well nowhere directly though there were indirect spin offs.  Your man Simms was a mathematician, and a good one.  He got into hight energy physics, submitted a paper, was seconded to such research, funded and given labs at the Cavendish. And, until now, not much more can be said except for two mysteries."     Matthew was beginning to be very interested.     "The first is that none of the research notes have ever been found.  There was some sort of explosion in the lab, late '44, and he was hospitalised.  How far he'd got with project Macabeus has never been fully established.  The second is that the research should have been terminated for lack of progress in late '41.  But it wasn't."      "Macabeus?" asked Matthew.     "The hammer."  Dr. Lester grinned.  "The original specification was for a sound generator that would use subsonics for the disbonding of molecular structures.  Should have been called Jericho, you know, walls of and trumpets.  Any way the idea was to aim it at enemy tanks or guns or whatever and them disintegrate them."     "It sounds a bit far-fetched," ventured Matthew.     "Not half as far fetched as some other projects, you'd be surprised what was tried.  Still, in theory it is possible. But even now such a weapon, apart from being superseeded by lasers has major practical problems.  Turning the sound into an aimable beam being only one of them, to say nothing of size and power utilization."     "So nothing came of it?"     "A tangled mass of wires, a hell of an electricity bill and a fire that could have burnt the lab down. It was assumed that the notes had gone up in the fire."    "And the second mystery?"    "Now that is the really intriguing one that may well be of more interest to you.  Research was funded by the Treasury, via the Ministry of Defence.  Projects approved by one of their sub committees were monitered and facilitated by  specifically designated civil servants.  One such group operated out of a place in Fenton Street, London.  It was a clerk in this office that was the liaison man with Dr. Simms."    Dr. Lester opened the drawer in his desk and pulled out a manila file.      "This is the Macabeus file," he put it on the desk in front of him.  I dug it out last night."    He opened it and took out a sheet of paper. A little thin wouldn't you say, even allowing for weeding."    "Weeding?    "Any sensitive papers are removed from government files before they are allowed into the public domain."    "Censorship."    "Yes, sometimes to protect the living, sometimes for reputations of 'Great Men', sometimes to cover expensive blunders or sometimes I think out of bloody mindedness."  Dr. Lester laughed, but without humour.  "However this file has only a start copy, and then progress satisfactory sheets and then an end file for Registry storage.  Now in itself that could mean nothing.  But, I also have a copy of the December 1941 memorandum from the Ministry to close down this particular research."     He passed the photostat over to Matthew.     "As you can see they feel that it was too theoretical and experimental."     Matthew passed the paper back.     "Now this sheet," he passed it to Matthew,  "is the continuing progress sheet and authorisation for funds to continue from the Treasury."     Matthew stared at the initials.     "Quite interesting."     "Yes," said Matthew.  "The 'M' in this case is for Maurice.  Maurice Vigor, my father."     Dr. Lester nodded.  "Well, too long ago for recriminations now."     "Why wasn't it noticed then?" asked Matthew.     "No one was checking.  Why should they?  No one would expect a minor Ministry of Defence clerk to alter the decisions of the government.  The more interesting question is why your father didn't stop Simms' work as he was instructed to do."     If Dr. Lester had any answer to his question he did not make it apparent.     "What happened to Simms?" asked Matthew.     "When the Allies liberated France and pushed into Germany, teams of scientists were sent in to see what Jerry had been up to in what was left of the factories and research plants.  Simms died in a booby trapped factory at Angoulime in Northern France."     "Oh," was all Matthew could think of to say.     "The report on his death was filed by Maurice Vigor."     "What?" Matthew sat up.     "All proper, no question of that.  Your father spoke fluent German and very good French and had been posted there as an area coordinator for the various teams.  It appears that he was at the same factory when it happened.  Sic transit gloria Simms."     "And my father?"     "That took a bit more tracking down.  I must admit to a certain curiosity over the whole issue.  he was transferred back to England after the end of hostilities in Europe and returned to Treasury Acccounting when Fenton Street was closed down.  He resigned from the Civil Service in the autumn of 1945 and so disappears from Government records."     Matthew was silent for awhile.     "I'm sorry I can't be more helpful," said Dr. Lester.     "Is the lab still..."     "No, long vanished in internal rebuilding."     "Where else did Simms live and work?"     "Here."     "In Cambridge?"     "Yes, here.  These are his old rooms, he was a fellow of the college you know."     Matthew looked round the room.  Had his father been here?     "And he had a cottage at Maddingly according to the college records."     "Do you have the address?"     Dr. Lester looked at him for a moment and then said, "Wintersweet, Maddingly.  It's still there but changed hands a few times.  His home was in Brighton.  His sister still lives there.  I wrote to her once in case he'd left any notes or records of his work there."     He wrote the address on a peice of paper and passed it over to Matthew.     "She may know something of your father, who knows?"     Dr. Lester tapped the envelope with his fingers, "Can I have these, just to go through?  They really do fill an enormous gap in my research."     Matthew nodded.  This was not destroying or otherwise disposing of them.  For the moment they were just on loan and they were of no use to him.  After all, Simms was not his particular quarry.     "Thank you," said Dr. Lester. "We'll keep in touch.  Who knows what else you might turn up."     Matthew agreed and gave him the shop address and the flat telephone number.     Dr. Lester stood up, "I'm not always so easy to get on the phone, but a letter always gets a reply.  If it's urgent ,ring the porter's lodge, they usually manage to winkle me out."  He smiled self depreciatingly.  "Good luck," he held out his hand. "And remember, you don't always find out what you maight want to find out, if I can put it that way."     Matthew was already aware of that fact.     After a exiguous and expensive lunch at the recommended Blue Boar, Matthew persuaded himself that he had enough time to look at the Maddingly cottage.  It would be another image, another place his father had been.     Jenny was at the desk and half way through an A4 pad when he returned.     "Only one customer," she said pointing at her day's work.  "Was it a useful journey?"     Matthew recounted what he had learnt from Dr. Lester.     "I'll confirm his German," she said. "He certainly writes with style and he is quite revealing about some of his feelings.  Did you go to the cottage?"     Matthew nodded, "I could see the tennis court from the road, but the cottage is nothing special, rather twee, probably much nicer then."     "Well, Ernst is less of a mystery, at least the 1936 Ernst is," said Jenny.  "It appears this was when they first met and made quite an impression on each other.  Most of this just covers those two weeks,"  she tapped her transcription.  "I wish he hadn't written in pencil though.  It's faded and rubbed out in places which makes some of it very difficult to read.  He could also be quite cryptic when he chose to be."  She paused.  "Matthew, I think your father had a crush on Ernst."     Matthew looked at her.       "I think he had more than that with Eric Simms," he replied.  "And if I'm right that could explain why he protected Simms' research from termination."     Jenny nodded and looked relieved.     Matthew was less so but didn't show it.  If his father had been homosexual or bisexual that was okay, but he was thinking of the books in the safe.  That was a different matter altogether."     "Do you want me to read it to you now?" she asked.     Matthew thought quickly.  It was half past four and he wanted to write up his notes and add to the time line.     "Look," he said, "Why don't we close up then go through it upstairs.  That is, unless you want to get away."     "No, that's fine with me," said Jenny.     "We could always send out for Chinese, I don't know about you, but I'm famished."   May, 1936.  Germany.     The train was crowded.  The woman next to him held a cavernous basket on her knees.  A broken oisier in the wicker weave snagged repetitvely at his overcoat raising a patch of new nap on the thin cloth.   He squeezed nearer to the window but it made no difference, the jagged wood still pressed teasingly against him.  She was heavy with the smell of cabbages, and sweat.  Her podgy hands folded over the rope handle trembled with the beat of the wheels.  Sounds, metamorphosed into flesh,  and avalanched against him with every clack and twist of the track.        He twisted his  wrist and looked again at his watch.  If this train is on time he will be four hours late.  But then, if the boat had docked on time in Hamburg and he had caught the first train to Lunbeck he would probably have had to stand all the way.       Maurice refused to look up.  He can feel the eyes play over him.  Blue, horizon seeking eyes, that are deep sheltered in the young weathered face of the knee that presses, now and then,  against his knee.  The eyes, the knee, the sea tight body, is with all the other sailors who crushed in with their kit bags and bundles who shouted to each other and pushed to make room where there was none.     Maurice looked instead at the old man sitting opposite.  He was sucking on an empty pipe and making wet saliva sounds that carried clearly over the coarse jokes, the clatter of the wheels, and the weazing of the fat woman's breath. The old man's  eyes were as wet as his chin where  dribble had run from the well chewed stem of his pipe, as yellow as the merschum bowl that was tended by the blunt thumb of the one hand that tapped the absent tobacco, and as empty as the right sleeve of his grimy jacket.     Maurice turned his head and looked out of the window at the passing fields seeing nothing.  Remembering.     "Maurice Vigor."      Mr. Lehrman weazed when he spoke.  He was thin and not that old, perhaps fourty, but he did not know for sure.     "I have some very good news for you, perhaps if you remain when the others have gone?"     It sounded like a question, but he knew it was not.  Everything Lehrman said sounded like a question, as if he was afraid to give orders in a Country that was not his own.     The rest of the class had looked briefly at him and then back at their books.  Mr. Lehrman was not popular as a teacher and there was little interest in what he had to say that was not directly related to text before them.     Afterwards, when the class had been dismissed he came and stood before Maurice.  He had placed a letter in front of him on the scratched, stained lid of the desk.      "It's from the German Embassy."  He'said.     Maurice could see the Eagle crest above the Hackencruze at the head of the crisp white paper and then his name.     "You are to be congratulated."  He'd stood stiffly waiting for Maurice to read the Gothic typescript.  "You are one of only five to have been selected.  Your essay was very good.  I said so at the time, excellent writing, excellent."     Maurice knew that Mr. Lehrman was nodding as he spoke.       Maurice had forgotten the essay.  It was over three months since he had handed him the produce of many scribbled attic evenings after his day's work.  He had not thought it particularly good, but he had enjoyed the challenge of the language.     Now he had been awarded two weeks holiday as a guest of the Third Reich.  All fares and expenses would be paid for. He would need only pocket money, a host family would be arranged.  He was to immediately confirm acceptance.     The next day he had asked for his summer holiday fortnight to be taken in May and Mr. Chapman had initialed his approval on the form without comment.          The carriage suddenly darkened and the fields vanished with a whoosh of air as the tunnel closed round the tight packed carriage.  The knee is now quite still against him, balancing the swaying train with an easy seabourne familiarity.  He is with the others yet apart from them.  His white shirt cleaner, pressed to sharp creases at the shoulders under the wide blue open collar, tucked neatly into the rough blue trousers.  Maurice can see the fourragere on his sleave and the guilt lettering of his ship's name on the front of the blue cap mirrored in the window.  The sailor looked up at the rack above the window where Maurice had heaved the heavy tattered leather case that weighed nearly as much empty as it did when packed.  He realised that the sailor was reading the now faded black lettering painted on the front edge of the lid above the handle.     It had belonged to his father,  'Pte. D. Vigor.  R.E (Signals).'  That and the photograph with the fold line across the middle was all that he had left to the world.  And Maurice, of course.     The sailor looked  down catching Maurice's eyes in the dark mirror of the window.  He felt himself blush, embarrassed, suddenly uncomfortable.  He just saw the smile as the reflection vanished and the fields returned.  Maurice kept staring out of the window.  What did he guess?  What did he know? The thoughts flushed his body, re-reddened his face.     He looked at his watch again.  He was hungry and hot.  Why hadn't he taken his coat off earlier when he had the chance to move?  His neck hurt and he was  tired.  He'd not slept well on the boat, with the excitement and the noise of the engines and the rise and fall of the bunk and the snores of his fellow travelers, as loud as his grandfather's he thought.   He wished he could wash and change.     There was a loud burst of laughter from the corner and Maurice heard the word 'gemoutlich'.  For a moment the knee pressed harder. He must have said something, he knew, and he's said something.  The sweat ran down Maurice's chest and he couldn't breathe.  Look out of the window he told himself, see what is there, describe it in German, then in French.  Concentrate.  He began to feel better.     The train  slowed, the fields were smaller now and gave way to sweeping forested hills.  The fat woman crushed against him as the line curved  and he turned his head.  He kept his  eyes down, seeing only the stiff legs, bent legs, of the sailors swaying to  absorb the rocking of the carriage.  One of them reached down to scratch himself, blatently, pulling at the thick cloth at his crutch.  His hand was blunt and brutal, the finger nails cut square and there were black oil stains along their edges and in the quick.  Maurice stared down at his own lap and waited.     "Lunbeck, Lunbeck."  A voice shouted outside the window.     The train jerked and stumbled to a halt shunting everyone against each other.  Maurice stood up, glad the platform was on his side of the carriage.  He reached up for his case.  The sailor was behind him and pressed against him, his arms reached either side of him getting to the handle of the case before him.  Maurice half turned caught in an embrace his face close to the sailor's whose breath was  sweet.  The door was opened from outside and Maurice  almost fell out.  A hand grabbed at his arm steadying him and then letting go as he stepped down.  The sailor  passed out his case and smiled with a knowing familiarity.       "Goodbye, English."  He said.     The fat woman pushed past him, turning to get her basket, skirts and buttock out of the door, blocking him from his view.  The door slammed shut.  He was still smiling at Maurice as the train pulled away and Maurice picked up his case.  The Ausfart was just ahead of him and the wind was cold and smelt of pines.          The tiny square outside the station was cobbled and around it shops and houses huddled together looking like a child's model.  Toy figures moved slowly along the street going in and out of the shops; a horse and cart tapped and creaked past a dribbling fountain set in the middle of the square and the wind flapped the distant red white and black swastika flags hanging down the front of the Rathouse.  There was a seat nearby, as Maurice, suddenly dizzy,  sat down, his head cleared and all grew back to size.       "Herr Vigor?"  An old man with white hair, his hat in his hand was beside him.     "Yes."  Maurice answered in English and then in German, remembering.     "I am Lutz, from the estate.  Herr Todt has sent me for you."     Estate?  Maurice didn't understand, but the name was right.  Ernst Todt, Lunbeck.  In his pocket was the letter; the Todt's are to be his host family.  He stood up.     "I am sorry I am late.  It was the boat."  He said.     "Herr Todt said I was to meet each train until you came."  The chauffeur reached down picking up the case with ease.  "Please follow me, sir."     The Mercedes pulled smoothly across the square, past the Rathouse and out onto a road that immediately began to climb up into the pined hills.  The interior of the car smelt only of leather and polish and Maurice sank back grateful for the soft seat after the hard wood of the train.  After about five minutes the car turned off the road through a pair of huge iron gates and began to slow down as it followed the slightly bending drive. Then it stopped as the trees cleared and he saw across the fields towards a great schloss set behind a lake.     "This is the best view sir."  The old man did not turn his head.  "Herr Todt told me to show it to you from here."     "This is where he lives?"  Maurice  asked stupidly.     "Yes sir, shall I drive on?"  he said.     Maurice nodded.     He started the car and Maurice realised he had been watching him in the mirror.                         The drive gave way to gravel and the car swept up and stopped in front of the schloss which was even larger and more impressive than it appeared from the road.  Great pillars stood before an oak door which must have been twenty feet high.  Maurice could not believe this was where he was  to stay.  The old man got out and opened the door for him.  As Maurice stood locked in disbelief while he fetched the case from the trunk.  The great door opened and a man in dark trousers and light green waistcoat came down the steps and took custody of Maurice and his luggage.     "I will show you to your room, sir."  He said.  Then he turned to Lutz.  "The car will not be needed tonight."     Lutz nodded and turned away before Maurice could say anything.     "This way, sir."  The green waistcoat led him through a hall hanging with flags and animal heads and began to climb a great sweep of dark wood stairs that led up onto a smaller landing.  They passed closed doors along a corridor hung with portraits and finally  stopped at the far end.     "This is your room sir."  He opened a door.     Maurice went in, the room was large and had ceiling-to-floor windows that looked out to the lake.     Maurice heard him open another door and he  turned.     "I will run a bath for you, sir.  If you need anything else please ring."  The servant nodded towards a bell rope that hung not far from the canopied bed.  "Herr Todt will meet you at six in the library.  I'll have someone call for you."  He left the taps running and closed the door behind him.     Maurice stood unbelieving, his battered case was on a dresser by the wall.  He looked in the bathroom.  It was larger than his room at home and it was rapidly filling with steam.          The bath was wonderful.  He felt the dirt and the tiredness from the journey soak away.  There was  still  nearly an hour before six.  There was no need to rush.  He could shave.  That was  something he really enjoyed.  There was a pile of large white towels on a small dresser; he'd only use the top one and then he could have a fresh towel each time he bathed.  A white bathrobe  hung on the door, he could just make out the initials 'ET', Ernst Todt,  woven on the pocket.  It was kind of him to lend it to me, thought Maurice, then he wondered if this was his room and he had let him have it while he stayed with him.  Already he thought Ernst Todt must be both rich and generous.  As he thought that a sudden feeling of  horror and loathing at his own inadequacy swept over him.     He possessed only the suit he had travelled in. At least he had a fresh shirt in his case; that thought helped  a little.  He didn't want to appear, he struggled for the right words to excuse himself, but gave up.  He  felt a stabbing hatred for being poor, for being only a clerk in the Civil Service Treasury Division,  for living in East London and having no father, only grandparents that ran a corner shop, and a mother that still cried for a lover who died eighteen years ago.     "But we won the war."  As he mouthed the words he  heard his grandfather speaking.  What ever happens abroad his grandfather always said that.     "And if this Mussolini, or that bloody Hitler gets out of hand we'll win the next one, too."  Grandfather didn't like what he saw in the newsreels.  He had got all worked up about the Rhineland.  But Maurice couldn't see what the fuss was about, as one paper had said, it was only Germany's backyard and Mr. Hitler had proposed a twenty-five year peace treaty.    "Mind you,"  Grandfather had gone on to add that particular time, "they've got their people back to work.  That's what our government should be doing, getting people back to work.  Building roads, spending some money, not putting threepence on the bloody income tax, and you can't trust the French, either."       Whatever he said he always managed to add that he didn't trust the French.     "And what do you want to go learning that rubbish for?"  He'd said to Maurice everytime he had set out to walk to Stratford for the W.E.A. evening classes.  "What you need is a trade.  What bloody good is German and French to an Englishman?"     Well, German has got me here, Maurice thought to himself, fortunate in that he found languages easy to learn. If there had been money, perhaps he could have gone on to college.  But he knew that was not true.  He wasn't much good at real learning, only languages,  not that it mattered.  He'd left school at fourteen.  There had been no money to stay on and the family had needed his earnings.  As for a trade, it hadn't kept his grandfather from being made redundant had it?     He  washed the soap off his arms and stood up.  The water roared down the plug hole as he  stepped onto the cork mat and began to carefully dry himself with the towel.     Later he looked in the mirror.  Not too bad.  His suit was not too crushed and his shirt was clean.  Hair combed back, he had put the top back on the Brilcream and wiped his hands.  It was five minutes to six.  He felt a sudden apprehension at the meeting to come but it was swallowed up by a greater sense of excitement.          The knock on the door was soft but clear.  He went  to open it then changed his mind.     "Come in."  He called.     The door opened.  A girl in white and black curtsied slightly.     "Herr Todt is in the library, sir."  She said.     He followed her closing the door to the room behind him.  They walked along the corridor and turned off through one of the doors he had noticed before.  It lead to a further corridor and more doors, then to a short stairway and they stopped finally before a double door.  The girl knocked, waited, then opened the door.     "Herr Vigor."  She announced.     He went in and the door closed behind him.     It was a large room, great windows along one wall, shelves ceiling to floor along the other walls, two great tables and a fire at the far end.  A man was by the fire, he turned and came towards Maurice with his hand outstreached.     "Maurice Vigor," he said, "I'm Ernst Todt, most pleased to meet you."  His English was impeccable.     He was dressed in a pair of casual trousers, a light coloured shirt, a cravat at the neck and a velvet short jacket in light brown.  He was slightly taller than Maurice with piercing blue eyes, blonde hair, and  a firm handshake.     "I do hope you did not mind me not meeting you personally, but I thought you may care to recover from your journey first."  His voice was perfect, the tone, the pitch, the elegance.     "Indeed not,"  Maurice replied in German, "I appreciate the thought and the chance to tidy up."  And to get over the shock of all this, he thought to himself.     "Your German is excellent, hardly a trace of accent."  He smiled as he let go of Maurice's hand.  "You must have been taught by a native."     Maurice nodded and supressed a smile as he thought of old Lehrman as a native.     "I certainly had not expected such,..."  He stumbled over the words and began to feel himself blushing.     He took Maurice's arm and lead him toward the fire.     "Oh, don't let all this impress you - inherited wealth, nothing more.  It's my grandfathers place really, an old family who have had time to,"  he paused, "collect things."  He smiled and Maurice's emergent embarrassment subsided.  "You'd be surprised at the responsibility it all is.  It will be my burden one day though, my father died just after I was born."     He must be about my age, Maurice thought, perhaps a little older.     "The war?"  Maurice said  it without thinking.     He looked at Maurice, "December 1917." He said.     "Mine was killed in August the same year."  Maurice replied.     "Then that is something else we have in common.  Sherry?"  He turned to the decanter on the table by the fire.     "Thank you."  Maurice said wondering what he meant by something else in common.     "Please sit."  He passed Maurice the glass and motioned him to a wing chair at one side of the log fire.       He sat opposite, in a matching chair.     "To your visit,  he raised his glass may it be all you could expect and more."       "Thank you."  Maurice couldn't think of anything else to say.     "Do tell me some more about yourself.  The letter I had said so little."  He  smiled softly.     "Mine just gave your name and the town."  Maurice replied sipping at the soft warmth of the drink.     "Tell me, what made you a German scholar.  I would not have thought it a popular language in your country."  He raised an eyebrow slightly as he spoke.     Maurice began to tell him about the W.E.A., and of Lehrman and how languages were the one thing he found easy to understand.  As he spoke Todt listened intently as if what Maurice had to say was of more importance than anything else in the world.  Now and again he  asked a question, and ocassionally he rose to refill their glasses.       "So your grandfather pawned his carpentry tools to place a bet?"  He querried.     "No, not directly."  Maurice could not help laughing.  "When Maples, the furniture factory made him redundant in '33 he pawned his tools to give him and my grandmother some money to keep them while he looked for another job.  But then in the paper he saw a horse named Chippendale running in a race and he put the money on as an impulse."     "And it won."  Todt nodded.     "At twenty to one.  My grandmother was furious."     "Because it won?"  He said.     "No, because it could have lost."  Maurice replied.     Todt roared with laughter.  "Then what?"     "She takes the money and puts a payment on the corner shop they still have."  Maurice was  laughing now, too.     "And so you and your mother live with them and you work as a Civil Servant for your Government?"  Todt summed it  up neatly.     "I hope to gain promotion."  Maurice said it quickly, knowing there is little chance, once a clerk always a clerk.     "I'm sure someone as gifted as yourself will be recognised."  There was no irony in his voice and for a moment Maurice believed what he heard.              Somewhere beyond the room a gong sounded.  Todt looked at his watch, "Good lord, dinner."  He stood up and took Maurice's  glass.  "Come on, let's get it while its hot."     Maurice looked at his watch; it was half past seven. He had been talking about himself for all this time and he still knew hardly anything about Todt who must have been reading his thoughts.     "Your turn to listen over dinner and I'll tell you about me."  Todt said.  "Not that it's half as interesting as your story."       The dining room looked like a barn and was quite cold even though a fire blazed in the cavernous grate behind them.  Two places were set on the long table and two servants stood behind their chairs.     "Grandfather is in Berlin."  Todt said sitting down, "But he should be back before you return so you may well meet him."     Maurice was  just about to ask him about his mother.     "Mother died in 1919.  I can hardly remember her now.  My uncles on her side also were lost in the war so I'm the last one of this family after grandfather."  Todt turned to the servant behind him, "Serve please."  He said.  Then to Maurice, "I hope you like venison?"     The food was both delicious and plentiful and he kept nodding to have their wine glasses filled as they ate.     "Herr Todt,"  Maurice  began.     "Ernst, please."  He said interrupting Maurice, "We are to be friends, aren't we?"     Maurice choked as a surge of emotion hit him, "Yes, oh, I hope so."  He finally said as he managed to take a  gulp of the wine.     "So, Maurice,"  Ernst said making the  name sound different, more exhaulted than Maurice had heard it before, "What were you going to ask?"     "What do you do?"  Maurice asked.     "Very little I must confess."  Ernst smiled at me.  "I'm suppossed to be studying engineering at Darmstadt because grandfather wants me to, but my passion, if you understand me, is filming."     "Filming?"  Maurice made it sound like he had said creating Heaven and Earth and kicked himself under the table.     Ernst laughed, "Its not that grand.  I have a Swedish Bolex, eight millimetre.  I just like to watch things, to film them and then to watch them."     "Could I...".  Maurice began.     "See some?  Of course, I love an appreciative audience."  Ernst turned.  "Coffee in the lounge and set up the projector."He looked at Maurice, "That is if you are not too tired?"       He was, but it didn't matter.     It was gone one, Maurice was lying in bed exhausted but he couldn't sleep.  He'd written up his journal, just the main points, but he thought he'd covered everything of the day.  The silence was unnerving.  There was no sound at all; the wind had dropped and the house wwas totally quiet.  He'd  never heard 'no sound' before and he didn't think he liked it.He was  thinking about Ernst's films.  Some shots of the house and the grounds and lots of birds flying and in their nests.  He must have climbed up some very high trees and waited for hours for those.  There was also a film of the lake.  That was the best.  Maurice adjusted his  position in the bed but he was just too tired.  He  just lay and thought about it.  Most of them were swimming but some were just lying about on the grass in the sun.  Ernst had shot the film last summer.  They were all members of the local Sturm Abteilung.  Ernst had said that he was not a member, but that he was happy to let them use his  grounds for their training.  They were totally natural, all of them, and very fit.  Maurice kept on thinking about it.     He woke up.  For a moment he couldn't remember where he was.  Then he did and it was still real. He looked at his watch.  It was past eight but he couldn't hear any movement in the house.  The sun was bright through the window and then he heard the wind, gently, softly, whispering  in the trees by the lake.      He did not know what to do.  Should he get up and go down to the dining room?  Or should he  wait there until someone came?  He felt himself panicking, he didn't want to make a mistake, not here.  Please what do I do?  The thought momentarily froze him. Think. Think.  He got up  and pulled the bathrobe about himself.  In one quick movement he jerked the bell rope and then went over to the window to look out across the lake and up over the fields to the hills.  He  waited.  There was a knock on the door and then it opened. He half turned as the girl came in.     "Good morning, sir."  She said with the slight curtsy.  "I will run your bath."  Maurice watched her go into the room and turn on the taps, and come out again.  "Will you want coffee here sir or in the morning room?"     "Where is, Er..".  He checked myself in time, "Herr Todt?"     "He is out riding sir."  She just stood there.     "In the morning room then."  He replied.     "Thank you sir."  She bobbed and was gone. He didn't see the point of another bath so he just washed quickly, and shaved, of course. As he walked over to his case the door opened and green waistcoat entered with an arm full of towels.  He said nothing as he put them in the bathroom and took the the one used, and the rest of yesterday's unused with him.  So, Maurice thought, fresh towels every day whether you need them or not.     He dressed more casually this morning, dark trousers and a vee neck pullover in light grey.    He went along the corridor and down the stairs, then he was lost.  He pretended to be looking at the flags and heads in the hall.  It worked.  The girl appeared with a covered tray.     "Shall I serve it now ,sir?"  She asked without the curtsy this time.     Maurice just nodded and she lead the way to the left of the hall and into a vast greenhouse of a room with palms, vines, potted flowers, and furniture all made out of cane and bamboo.  She put the tray on a small table.  There were papers and magazines nearby.     "Please ring if you require anything."  She poured him a cup of coffee as she spoke.  He saw a small silver bell on the tray.  "Herr Todt will join you here when he returns."  With that she was gone.     The room was warm, the sun streamed in through the glass and the leaves and trunks of the plants dapple the light into small shadows as it fell across the stones, tiles, and wood of this exquisite room.  Enchanted, he  sipped at the coffee and picked up a magazine. He began to read an article on the Fatherland Front in Austria and a profile of Schuschnigg.             "Is it still hot?"     Maurice turned quickly.  Ernst was standing by the door.  He was wearing jodpers, riding boots  and an English hacking jacket.  Maurice had seen pictures of people dressed just like this in Tatler.     He reached for the coffee.     "No."  he said.     "Heidi."  Ernst called coming over to pull up a chair beside him.  He sat down and threw his legs out before him and then propped  them on the edge of the table.     "So, I hope you are well rested?"  He said to Maurice. "More coffee." he spoke louder over his head.  Heidi must have come to the door but Maurice did not look up."Tomorrow you can ride with me. I'll get Hans to call you at six thirty.  But today I'll show you the grounds and the village.  You would like that?"     "Yes."  Maurice was  worried about riding.  He'd never been on a horse before.     Ernst sensed that.  "Don't worry."  He said, "Lady is as quiet as a mouse you'll see."    A fresh tray arrived with coffee and cakes. Ernst devoured two with obvious relish and filled Maurice's cup and then his own.            Later they took the car, Ernst drove.  The grounds were enormous and criss-crossed with driveways.  He had thrown the Bolex onto the back seat.     "You never know,"  he said. "I like to be ready."     Finally they drove down to the far side of the lake.  There set in a natural dell of tress was the most perfect summerhouse of wood and dark brick.  Ernst pulled up beside it.     "This is my favourite place; no one uses it but me.  Come on."  As he said this he leapt out of the car, jumped over the small veranda and pushed open the front door.     The inside was all polished wood and there was a fireplace built into the back wall with swords and guns racked over it.     "Just a couple of bedrooms, a shower, and a little kitchen."  He  pushed doors open as he spoke.  "Far more, what is the word, cozy?"     "Cozy, yes."  Maurice said in a daze, "That's the word."     "There's a boathouse by the side. Do you like to row?"  Ernst turned to him, "Excellent excercise for the arms and chest."     Maurice nodded.  He'd rowed a little on Hollow Pond.  Thank goodness there was something he could do.          By two o'clock Maurice was famished and totally lost.  Ernst had driven him all over the estate pointing out places of special interest and  telling him stories about his ancestors.  Finally they ended up at the stables where he introduced Maurice to Lady, whom Maurice had to admit, did seem docile enough as she nibbled daintily at the apple Ernst had given him to feed to her.     "Lunch?"  Ernst said at last, "You look hungry."     They went back to the schloss, where a cold buffet was waiting in the dining room.  Ernst heaped a plate and ate standing with his back to the fire.  Maurice  joined him.     "I'll change and then we can go into the village.  Time for you to see some local culture."  he laughed,  "Meet some real Germans, eh?"  Late May 1936											#   The moonlight streams in through the windows lighting the whole room.  I can read my watch with ease.  It is ten thirty.  I've had my bath.  With a call at half past six tomorrow and then riding it makes sense to get it over with now.  I'm not really looking forward to riding but I suppose it will be alright.  So far I've written this without the bed light on, but pencil is not that easy to read.  That's better, now I can see!  The village was very rural, certainly compared to London!  But what was most interesting was the deferance most people, especially the older ones, show to Ernst.  The estate either employs, or indirectly provides jobs for most of them.  Yet it is more than that - almost like a feudal system, which I suppose it is with Ernst as the Lord, especially when his grandfather is away.  Nothing really noteworthy about the shops or the architecture, except many of the houses have rhymes or sayings carved on the exterior beams - quite pretty really.  The pub was fun.  Lots of ompah music and singing and enormous beers.  I only had one, quite enough, though its not that strong.  When we first got there it was mainly older people and families, but by about half seven quite a few younger groups turned up.  The girls favour a sort of local dress, all flounces and blouses.  The men wear leiderhosen and shirts or a sort of heavy duty cloth trouser.  Most of them acknowledge Ernst with respect, though some appear quite casual.  Not that it appeared to bother Ernst either way.  He is unfailingly polite, yet distant, to all of them.  He really is a most amazing person.  Certainly the most amazing person I have ever met.  He can do anything and better than anyone else.  He has a sort of presence. I can't explain it better, perhaps when I have known him longer it will be easier to say what it is.  He does seem to like me and despite all the obvious differences we do have many things in common.  I'm so glad I came here.  I must thank old Lehrman properly when I get back, particularly as I didn't really take it seriously when he said he had entered my essay into the competition.  Perhaps he got a fiver or something for doing that, who knows!       Before we left, a big rough looking man, about twenty four or five I suppose, came to the doorway and just stood there.  He looked around at everyone with a slight sneer across his pig-ike face.  I could be mistaken, but I'm sure both the music and the general conversation in the room went quieter, then he just turned and went out.  I asked Ernst who he was and all he said was, "Nobody really, certainly not now."  I wanted to ask more but I had the clear impression Ernst did not want to say anymore, certainly not then.  Perhaps I'll ask him some other time.'						     Maurice put the journal and pencil on the side table.  He knew he would have no trouble sleeping. It really had been a very good day.  But tomorrow?  That was going to be very different.   A car was one thing, but a horse?  Even with those thoughts rearing themselves into a real fear, the day's tiredness won and he slipped into a dreamless sleep.       Lady raised her head and for a moment Maurice thought she would run after Ernst who had galloped well ahead.  He pulled back on the reins and she snorted, but  continued to amble toward the distant lake.  (Maurice  hoped he hadn't ruined Ernst's morning ride as all he'd been able to do was stay on while she walked.)  They had tried to canter but he had  soon lost the rhythm and would have slipped off if Ernst hadn't taken the reins from him.  Maurice didn't think he'd make a horseman.  Even just walking had made him very sore.  He'd now lost sight of Ernst among the trees, but there was nothing he could do but stay on and hope.  Walking wasn't too bad, really.  The thing that surprised him the most was how high up he was, even on Lady who was quite a few inches shorter than the great beast Ernst was riding.  At last he saw him again coming out of the trees far to his right.  Ernst was  galloping at a great speed riding low  against the horse's neck.  He was making a great arc and swinging back towards Maurice.  For a moment Maurice panicked.  Lady was moving sideways as she heard them approach.  Maurice patted her neck and 'clicked' at her and it seemed to work.     "Ho, Maurice!"  Ernst  called out to him.     Maurice waved back quickly loathe to let go of the reins with either hand.     In a flurry of kicked turf he pulled up beside him.     "What a brilliant day don't you think."  He said.     He didn't have a hair out of place and Maurice was sure he wasn’t even perspiring.  He could  feel himself wet all down his stiff back merely from the effort of just staying on.     "It's a lot warmer."  Maurice said..     Ernst laughed.  "You've done very well, old chap.  You've been on her now for two hours."     His praise sounded sincere and Maurice felt better.     "We'll just get down to the lake and then have some refreshment.  I've a few things in my pack."  Ernst  rode close beside him as he spoke and Maurice  felt his confidence grow.     "That sounds good to me."  Maurice said and really meant it.     "Fancy a swim when we get there?  It'll take the stiffness out of you."  Maurice nodded.  Lady had quickened her step to match the stallion and he was having to really concentrate to stay on. At last they reached the edge of the lake and Ernst swung himself to the ground and took the reins from Maurice.     "Hop off then."  He patted Lady's flank.  "I told you she was a good one, didn't I?"     Maurice dropped clumsily to the ground and his legs wobbled for a moment.     Ernst droped the reins over their heads and let go.     "They'll just graze here; we can leave them.  Come on."  He untied the pack from the saddle of the stallion and they made their way down to a small coved shore with two great flat boulders half in the water.  He sat by one of them and began to pull of his boots.     "I didn't bring any trunks."  Maurice said trying not to sound silly.     "Me neither."  Ernst pulled off his shirt muffling the words.     He was tanned and well muscled.  Maurice looked away.     "Come on. Quick in and out, and then we can eat, I'm famished."  He grabbed at Maurice's shoe and gave it a tug.     While Maurice struggled with the other one Ernst pulled off his jodpers and ran straight into the water.       He was a couple of hundred yards out into the lake before Maurice was ready.  Maurice stepped into the water and gasped.  Ernst turned and shouted something but Maurice can't make it out.  He waved and Ernst waved back and began to swim parallel to the shore with a smooth crawl that hardly rippled the water.  Maurice watched with envy and admiration.  Taking a deep breath he plunged in.  It was like being in a liquid ice and his lungs clamped up on him.  He made a few strokes and then began to breathe.  After a moment he got used to it.  The water was so clear he could see the weed and stones falling away beneath him as he swam out toward Ernst with a careful breaststroke.       "Good?"  Asked Ernst as Maurice reached him.     "Great." Maurice said watching Ernst's legs under the water as Ernst turned to duck dive under him.  He came up with a handful of mud which he let drop clouding the water.     "Five meters here."  He grinned.     Maurice did not doubt it, the bottom was much darker now and less distinct.     "Race you back."  Ernst changed his stroke to match Maurice's and they turned to the shore.     Maurice pulled hard and ducked his head as they raced back.  Ernst was now not so fast and Maurice kept up with him.  They made the rock almost together.     The wind was still warm and the stone had absorbed the morning sun.  They rubbed themselves part dry with their shirts and then spread them out to dry.  With a casual movement Ernst pulled off his underpants, wrang them out and put them beside his shirt.  Maurice hesitated for a moment and then followed suit.     Ernst pulled the bag towards him.       "Look at this, cheese, bread and a thermos of coffee.  Plus, a small bottle of schnapps to warm the inner man."  He passed Maurice a cup and unscrewed the thermos.     "Thanks, that's good."  Maurice said as he took a sip of the scalding liquid.     Ernst grinned at him and poured a tiny drop of the schnapps into a metal cup.  He tossed it back, refilled it and passed it to Maurice.     For a moment Maurice could not breath, then he coughed.     "Christ."  He croaked.     Ernst poured another for himself and then again for Maurice who  sipped this one more carefully while Ernst cut off a hunk of cheese and tore at the bread.  They ate in silence and then they half lay back soaking up the sun.  Maurice could not but see that Ernst was, unlike himself, circumcised; he was also truely blonde and had the most beautiful and perfect body he had  ever seen.     "Tell me Maurice,"  Ernst turned towards him, "What do the English think of our new Germany?"     The question caught Maurice totally unprepared.     "Well,"  he said lamely, "It depends."     "On what?"  Ernst asked.     "On who you mean by England."  Maurice said.     "Please, try to say, I'm really very interested."  He put his hands behind his head and Maurice watched the shoulder muscles ripple into smooth bulges.     Maurice swallowed and sought to be  diplomatic.  "There's a lot of praise for solving unemployment, and for the road building, at least the Newsreels show that side of it."     "And the other side?"  Ernst had his eyes shut against the sun.     "Well,"  Maurice said slowly, deciding to be honest, "A lot of the papers talk about a dictatorship.     Ernst nodded.     "And then there's the fear that the army could mean another war.  I mean, all those rallies and marching."  Maurice stopped.     "Your army is bigger than ours; so's the French army and the Russian."  Ernst spoke slowly, his eyes still shut.     Maurice shrugged.  "Yes, but I think that's what people are afraid of."     "Are you afraid of that?"  Ernst asked after a moment.     "No, I don't think so."  Maurice said having not really thought about a war in his lifetime.     Ernst turned on his side to face Maurice who tried not to look at his body.  He put his hand on Maurice's arm.     "Germany does not want a war with anybody.  You understand?  But we must be strong so that no one will attack us.  You have the English Channel for protection.  Whilst we have the revengeful French and the Poles and  behind them all, the communists of Russia and the Jews."  His voice was serious.     "Do you think they want a war?"  Maurice kept his voice as steady as he could.     "I think they want what they can take with ease."  Ernst sat up.  "That is why we must be strong.  The strong do not need to fight; it is such strength that prevents fighting.   You must understand my friend, Germany does not want to fight with anyone."      For a moment he was silent and then he continued.     "After the last war we were betrayed and used  because we were weak.  This will not happen again.  But there is more than that," he paused. "We have recognised our mission because our Furhrer has seen what must be done."      "Mission?"  Maurice didn't understand what he was hearing.     "That is what you are not told by your press, radio or films.  Germany has a mission and a destiny that you can share.  All Anglo-Saxons can share in this vision, this reality of a better purer world.  And do you know why you are not told of this and we are?"     Maurice  shook his head.     "Because your press, your BBC, your film studios, your big business is controlled not by you, but by a conspiracy.     "Who does control it, then?"  Maurice was now both curious and a little annoyed by what Ernst is saying.     "Rank, Rothermere, Marks and Spencer, Lipman, Lyons, even in your government there are such people, such Jews who have an allegience only to themselves and to money.  Even in Russia there are Jews who are communists."      Maurice heard the iron conviction in Ernst's voice as he spoke.     "Look around you, look around the world at the filth and poverty and degradation and behind it all you will find Jews.  Like a disease they feed on the weak and the willing alike, catering to the lowest basest tastes for their profit and power."  He stood up, the sun glinting in his hair.     "Maurice, I will not try to persuade you; I just ask that you think about this.  In your history was a man called Gresham who recognised that the base elements, if they are allowed, will destroy and drive out the pure.  To be pure you must not allow any contamination because this leads to weakness and to death.  Your Darwin said this, too, the survival of the fittest; it is the true way of nature.  This is Germany's sacred mission.  To rid the world of the base and to restore the pure to rightful primacy, for all mankind's benefit."       Maurice sat up.  Ernst's words churned in his head.     Ernst put both his hands on Maurice's shoulders and he felt the warmth and energy of his body.     "But not by a war, certainly not by any war begun by us, though we will fight if we are attacked."     His hands  gripped Maurice tighter.     "We must do it by example, by showing the way and by sacrifice if need be."  He turned away from Maurice who reached to pull on his now dry underpants not wanting  his arousal to be seen.      There was a silence between them.  Then Ernst turned back.     "Please, forgive me,"  his voice was softer now. "It is just that I think you will understand if you are allowed to see what I can see.  We need people who will be our allies in this task. It is a big world and not all of it is bad.  I do not mean to give you a lecture."  He laughed.  "But I have, haven't I?"     Maurice felt a release of the tension that had built up between them and he laughed, too.     "Yes, you have," he said.     "Well, at least I can now talk a little more about National Socialism, about honour and purity and pride and you will see that there is far more to it than roads and marching."     Maurice remembered something he had read in a magazine a couple of years ago.     "The people and the Nation are one, Das volk ist alles."  He said quietly.     Ernst gripped his hand.     "I knew you would understand."  He let it go, "More talk another time.  Now we ride back, eh?"   He said and began to pull on his clothes.            Maurice  found it easier riding back. He leaned into the saddle feeling the hardness of the leather and his own hardness suddenly melt in a wave of pleasure as he watched Ernst riding just ahead of him.  He was  not really thinking about what Ernst had said, but the words were in his head like seeds in fresh turned soil.     They sat in the breakfast room which still had all the afternoon sun.  Ernst was reading a book on mechanics.  He said he must write a paper for his professor before the end of the month.  He had given Maurice a copy of Mein Kampf  and had marked a couple of pages for him to look at.  Maurice found the language clumsy and the expression crude, but the message was clear and it helped him to see what Ernst had been saying.     "Maurice."  Ernst  put down his book.     Maurice looked up.     "How would you fancy moving into the summerhouse?"     "Me?"  He said puzzled.     "Both of us, say for a few days.  Hans could bring down all we need and do whatever is necessary and we could ride and swim and whatever."     "Yes, yes, I'd like that."  Maurice said enthusiastically.     "Good, then I'll arrange it.  We can do some filming, too.  I think the good weather will be with us for a few days, don't you?"     "Yes," he said nodding, "I think it will."     "Good."  said Ernst and he went back to his reading.                				         #     'Ernst has gone into the village.  He has not said why.  I think he may still be angry with me but I can't be sure.  It is a great pity and all from a misunderstanding at first; and then of course  I made it worse by insisting.  Such a pity, especially as the last three days by the lake have been the most wonderful in my life.  We have been swimming and riding. I am getting better at both!  We spend most evenings talking about England and Germany and the truth of National Socialism.  There is so much we have not been told at home.'     Maurice underlined 'such a pity' and his pencil  snapped.  He got up and took the penknife from the table.  He stared into the grate as he eased off the wood into a neat point.  He wanted to set it down exactly as it happened because he was  sure there was more to it than there appeared to be.  Something between Pig Face and Ernst that went back a long way. He sat down and pulled the journal onto his lap.						#     'We had driven into the village and had gone to the pub at about seven.  We were sitting talking when Pig Face came up to us.  This time he was wearing his Sturm Abtialung uniform and had four of his cronies with him.  He stood in front of us and they stood just behind him so as to block out the rest of the room from our view.       "You have not forgotten Saturday?"  says Pig Face.  He has an unpleasant and arrogant voice that makes one immediately dislike him even if one didn't already.     "No."  replies Ernst, not bothering to look up or move his leg from the chair which was blocking Pig Face from getting as near to us as I can see he wanted to.     "Five, in the morning."  Pig Face says it in such a way as to imply Ernst may think he meant in the evening.     There is a period of silence, then Ernst said, "Is there some doubt then?"  But he said it in a tone that was a mixture of natural superiority plus mild irritation at this unecessary interruption.  If it was calculated to upset Pig Face it certainly worked.     Pig Face stood even stiffer than before and the snear on his face is more pronounced.     "Not with us Herr von Todt." Pig Face emphasises the title as if he is comparing the decadence of the old, unawakened, unrevolutionised Germany with the New Order of which he, as an Obergrupenfuehrer of the local SA, is the sole guardian.  (Not that I think he really understands anything other than marching and shouting from what Ernst had already told me about him.  He calls Pig Face one of the last dinosaurs of the Rohms' bully boys who tried to take over and had to be curbed.  All brawn and no brain!  His real name is Kurt Lutz. Its a pity such a nice man as old Lutz should have such a son.)     Suddenly Ernst stands up in one flowing movement and is eye-to-eye with Pig Face.     "Then you are suggesting there is with me?"  Ernst's voice has an edge to it I have not heard before and it makes me think of a razor drawn over tight terrified flesh.     "We have not seen you at any meetings or exercises for some time."  Pig Face's tone is slightly less offensive.     "You know I have been away and now I have a visitor with me."  Ernst's voice ,too, is marginally softer.  "However, I would not miss the Flag March, not even for my English friend."  The sarcasm he puts into this is obviously lost on Pig Face.     "You could have brought him to a meeting."  Pig Face does not want to give up.     "Perhaps I could come on the Flag March?"  I say.  The words are out of my mouth before I see Ernst's hand flick an urgent signal to me to keep quiet.       "Delighted."  Says Pig Face with all his old arrogance returned.  "The pleasure will be ours."  He sneers showing uneven and stained teeth.     Had he had the slightest doubt that he was losing ground to Ernst my words had some how given him an unexpected victory.  He clicked his heals and turned away.  His cronies stepped aside as he strode away from our table and they fell into step behind him.  They left the pub without a backward glance.      Ernst sat down.       "Not good."  Was all he said as he dumped his legs out on the chair opposite.     I didn't know what to say at first then I say hesitantly, "I thought it might help you, I mean if you should have been at a meeting and didn't because ..."     Ernst raises his hand to stop me.  "I go to their meetings sometimes because I choose to, not because I have to.  They are fools, full of shit about a revolution tomorow about which they understand nothing.  Then, now, tomorow, Germany will be ruled by brains and nobility not  by cretins who know nothing of Socialism and couldn't even draw our National boundaries even if they had a map to copy from.  And before you ask, I choose to go with them because it pleases me to be able to do whatever they can do only better."     After a long silence I ask, "What is the Flag March?"     "A very necessary symbol.  Many people find symbols easier than thoughts, easier than words.  They need to see and do so they can feel part of their history even if they do not understand it.  Kurt Lutz and his boys will carry the group flag on a march from here to Metletzburg as a tribute to the Furhrer, to National Socialism and to Germany.  Last year I marched with them.  This year I shall march with them and film them.  It was a silly promise I made to Lutz last summer at the lake.     I still could not see the problem.     "How far is Metletzburg?"  I ask.     "Fifteen miles there and fifteen back."  Ernst is looking straight at me.  "I do not think you often walk that far and certainly not in those shoes you wear."     I can't believe he means thirty miles and all I say is "Oh."     "You have asked to join them and have been accepted.  What you do not realise is that it is a matter of sacred honour to complete the march."  Ernst is silent for a moment then he says, reading my thoughts, "And if you feel your honour is of no matter to you, it is to me.  You are my guest.  You, a poor Englishman, a worker, are not seen as that.  You are seen as one of us, a gentleman of privilege, soft and suspect, effete.  However it is not your problem.  I will have Hans take you on a trip somewhere and tell them it was previously arranged, is part of your itnerary and cannot be changed."     "No."  I say, though even now I don't know what made me say it.  "I will go.  I can carry your extra reels."  I see Ernst's eyes darken and I quickly add, "Unless you prefer me not to, of course."     Ernst just smiles, but it is not a very pleasant smile although his words are said gently.  "Well Maurice, if you insist I will take it as an honour to have you with me."     Then he gets up and we drive back to the summerhouse.  He doesn't say much more that night and rides alone this morning.  Now he is out in the village.'						#     Maurice closed his journal and slipped it into his case.  He was not really looking forward to tomorrow, but thirty miles can't be that bad.       He  went into the kitchen and put the pot on the stove, he may as well make a cup of coffee.  As he walked back to his chair and book he heard the car pull up outside.       "Right."  Said Ernst the moment he came in the door, "Try these on."  And he threw a pair of boots at Maurice which he caught, by some miracle.  "They should fit. I took a drawing of your shoe size, and as you can see they are nicely worn in."  He grinned at Maurice who hoped himself forgiven?     "Thanks," he said. "How...?"          "Don't ask!"  Ernst said and slapped him on the back as he went into his room.     "Try a couple of pairs of these if they are still a bit loose.  Do all Englishmen have such small feet?"  He tossed Maurice some of his light grey socks.     Maurice shrugged as he tried on the boots, with the socks they fit quite well.     "They'll be fine."  He said.     "And I've got a bag for the film and a better harness for the camera."  Ernst stood behind Maurice who felt his hands on his shoulders, "We'll show them."  Ernst said and Maurice knew he was forgiven.                         It was just gone four when they got up and still quite dark.  They dressed quickly and packed some food and a flask.  Ernst had already checked the camera and film. Maurice noticed that he had clipped a small dial onto his waist but he didn't ask what it was.  Maurice could not help acknowledging to himself that he felt quite nervous about the coming day.  They nibbled at some bread and sausage as Ernst drove them to the village square and they were the first to arrive.By a quarter to five, Lutz arrived with his cronies and by five the whole group was lined up in formation.  A few people had come out to see them off, including the Ratmeister who was wearing his old uniform of a Cavalry captain complete with his medals.     Ernst and Maurice were the only ones in the group not wearing uniforms and they stood to the side as Lutz gave the order to quick march.  Maurice stood beside Ernst as he filmed the column leaving the square and then they ran to catch them up.  They kept just behind them for a while so that Ernst could take what he called, dark mood shots.  He filmed low on the ground as if he had been marched over, aiming the camera to catch the rising boots retreating from them into the gloom of the dawn.  They then ran ahead of the column to film the bright faces of the men as they marched into the camera and the future as Ernst said in reply to Maurice's running questions.     "We'll leave it now until the sun comes over the hill and get the first real light to illuminate the whole column."  Said Ernst, who obviously had a plan of all the shots he wanted.     By the time they had reached the next village it was quite light and the main street was lined with children and mothers who all waved and cheered.  It was really quite exciting and Maurice was  beginning to enjoy it as they raced ahead, filmed and then to the side to take in all the different angles.  Everyone kept clear of Ernst and Maurice so as not to get in the way of the camera.  This gave Maurice an unaccustomed sense of importance which he could not deny he enjoyed.       "About eight miles to go now."  Ernst said, "How are you feeling?"     "Hot, but bearing up."  Maurice replied.     "Good, its mainly downhill now to Metletzburg, but that will make it harder coming back so keep your laces tight."  He gave Maurice a pat on the back which generated a surge of energy within him from this encouragement.     So far it had been easier than Maurice had thought it would be.  He found that all the spectators and the shouts from the farms they passed make both the time and the distance shrink.  They kept on marching, Ernst and Maurice bringing up the rear of the column and sometimes  having children marching with them as they went through the little hamlets.  Even here the flags were flying and often the children were carrying small Swastica flags which they waved as they walked.     By nine they could see Metletzburg in the distance and Maurice was sure he could hear the welcoming band playing the Radetzki Marsch as they came down the long slope into the square.  Lutz began to sing the Group song in a rough but powerful voice and soon everyone else joined in.     "We've got to get there first to get them coming in."  Said Ernst.  "Can you run?"     "Yes."  said Maurice, though he was beginning to feel a stiffness creeping into his thighs and his left foot was beginning to prickle at the heel.     They ran ahead and were greeted with loud cheers as they reached the crowded square first.  The whole village had to be there!  By the fountain there was a stand with the band and the Ratmeister and some other official-ooking men and also a tall thin man in a black uniform.  At first Maurice didn't recognise the uniform and then came the recognition and the realisation.     "Colonel Dikemann, SS Commader of the Northern Gau."  said Ernst.  "A very powerful man and an old friend of my Grandfather."     Lutz and the Group marched in to a roar from the crowd and a fanfare from the band.  They lined up in front of the stand and Lutz dipped the flag to Colonel Dikemann who saluted the flag and then Lutz.  Maurice and Ernst  stood to the right and Ernst kept filming.  Dikemann raised his hand and there is instant silence except for  the cry of a child somewhere in the crowd.  Dikemann looked in that direction and the crying stopped.  He gave a short speech and then there were three roars of Seig Heil and a burst of applause.     "Right, now we can take a break."  Said Ernst as he unhooked the camera and changed reels passing the used one to Maurice to stow carefully in the bag.     "What happens now?"  Maurice was desperate to sit down and to rest.  His legs had suddenly began to feel like lead pipes.     "Food, drink, about an hour's break and then back again.  There's a small cafe I know just behind the square.  It will be less crowded and we can relax there.  Come on."  Ernst shouldered his way through the crowd and soon, to Maurice's great relief they were sitting before a a good plate of hot stew and a stein of beer.  To Maurice, food and drink had never tasted so good before.  He wished this was the end of it though and that they didn't have to march back again!     Maurice, replete, was leaning back against the wooden wall when he realised that the cafe had gone silent.  He opened his eyes and there, standing right in front of the table was Colonel Dikemann.  His face was totally expressionless and he was looking straight at Maurice whose blood ran cold for a moment and he felt his mouth drop open.  A smile just flitted across Colonel Dikemann's face and then he turned to Ernst.     "So, young Todt," he said, "How are you?"     Ernst went to stand up but Dikemann raised his hand.     "No, I'll sit with you."  He said as he took off his cap and placed it carefully on the table.     He pulled a chair from a nearby table and sat opposite them.     "How are the studies going?"  He asked.     "Well sir,"  said Ernst.     "Excellent.  I expect great things from you."  Then he looked at Maurice.  "And how is our English Government spy?"       As Maurice realised what  had been said he felt the blood drain from his face.  He heard himself stammer something, but it made no sense.     Dikemann suddenly roared with laughter and patted Maurice on the arm.     "Just my little joke, Herr Vigor.  I'm very pleased to see you here.  I hope you will enjoy the rest of your holiday and my congratulations on your excellent essay.  Now I must go."  He stood up.  "Ernst, a word."     Ernst stood up and they both moved towards the door.  Dikemann was speaking very softly and Ernst was just nodding his head.  Then they shook hands and Dikemann was gone and conversation returned to the cafe.     "You look like you have seen a ghost,"  said Ernst as he sat down again and drained his stein.     "Why did he call me a spy?"  Maurice was still shaken.     "He was pulling your leg, nothing more."  And the smile on Ernst's face went a long way to convincing Maurice that was all there was to it.     They got up to go and Ernst reached into his pocket to pay.     "Please, no sir,. It is an honour to serve you."  The chef was almost bowing to Ernst, "Please come again."       Ernst smiled at him and nodded, but said nothing as they left the cafe.     Outside the sun was hotter and the square even more crowded.     "Come on. We'll go up to the tower and get a high shot," said Ernst as the band began again and Maurice could see the Group forming up for the return.     They climbed quicky up the twisting stairs and Maurice leaned against the stone window catching his breath as Ernst hung out with the camera filming until the column was out of sight.     "Now we'll just stay behind until we get to Lunbeck and then get them coming in and that's it for the day.  Ready?"     Maurice nodded wearily and they clattered down the stairs and made their way through the dancing couples who are obviously going to keep the band playing and intend to make a full day of it.         By the time they had caught up the rear of the column, Maurice was beginning to feel a bit sick but he didn't say anything.  The road sloped gently upwards and he could feel the difference it made to the strain on his knees and calves and the film bag was getting uncomfortable on his shoulder.     Ernst appeared locked in some thoughts of his own and Maurice was glad just to concentrate on walking.  By the time the road flattened out again, Maurice's foot had begun to slip inside his left boot and could feel a raw  spreading pain taking hold.  He began to favour it a little taking the weight on his right, but after another couple of miles that foot began to burn, too.  He tried not to think about it and to just  concentrate on putting one foot before the other.  He could see the forested hills a long way ahead, but at least once they were over the first one it was only a couple more miles to the village.  He  kept walking.     Ernst was still silent and Maurice wondered if he, too, was feeling the distance.     Time and pain began to blur and Maurice felt  the sun crashing down on his back.  He was desparate for a drink of water and began to recite conjugations of irregular French verbs to himself to stop thinking about his feet and legs.  At last, out of the corner of his eye he saw the three mile marker.  They must have gone through all of the hamlets but he hadn't noticed them, nor heard any cheers.  He tried to focus on the men ahead of him but all he could see was a blur and dust from the road.     Suddenly he felt Ernst grabbing at his arm.     "Come on, run."       "What?"  He gasped.     "Run," said Ernst, "Run.  Lutz has called for double time for the last mile. We must keep up."     Maurice forced his legs to move.  He couldn't feel his feet anymore, but there was an unpleasant throbbing in his kness and groin.  He knew he must be running because the bag was banging faster against his back.  There was a roaring in his ears and his chest hurt.  They ran and ran and ran and ran.  They passed the column.  Then they were into the square and Maurice could see the car.  He felt Ernst's arm around him.  He had taken his weight as he pulled the door open and pushed Maurice onto the seat.  He  forced something into his mouth that burnt his throat.     "Go on, drink."       Maurice gulped and spluttered.  He could hear Ernst talking, but he couldn't make any sense of the words.  There was a roaring and shouting.  He  made out the Seig Heils and there was a trumpet playing fanfares.The noise went on and on and Maurice was still running.  He could feel himself swaying and moving, but he was not doing anything.  He was moving without volition.   Then it stopped.  He was being lifted.  It was cooler and darker and everything was fading away.     "Maurice, Maurice."  Something stung his face.  He didn't care.  He wanted to sleep.  "Maurice!"  The sting was harder and he opened his eyes.     Ernst swam into focus, then out again.     "I'm sorry," Maurice mumbled, blurring the words, "I'll get it this time."  He moved his hand trying to reach for the tripod release, "I can't find the lever, I can't."   He felt tears running down his face.     "Oh Maurice."       Arms held him and rocked gently, then it went black again.     Red pain screamed at him and he opened his eyes hearing himself cry out.     He looked down.     Ernst had a knife in his hand and  was cutting at the left boot pulling Maurice's leg as he did.  Maurice's  right leg ended in a red bowl and he couldn't see his foot.     He screamed and Ernst looked up, dropped the knife and held him very tightly.     "Quiet," he whispered, "Quiet.  I must get the other boot off."     Maurice gripped his knees with his hands as Ernst bent down again.  The boot fell away and he cut at the red sock then threw it down with the other one.  He lifted the foot and gently placed it in  the bowl with the other one.  Some of the blood water spilled out onto the floor staining the white towel.  There was no feeling at all now.     "Ice water,"  Ernst said, "To bring down the swelling."     He passed Maurice a cup.     "Drink," he ordered.     It was bitter, but Maurice drained it down and felt a relief spread through him.     "What is it?"  He managed to make the words coherent.     "Morphine," said Ernst, "For the pain."     But Maurice had no pain that mattered now, just echos that howled in a far distance, receeding fast,  while he watched Ernst lift the feet out onto the floor.  He went to change the water and Maurice looked hard at the raw and oozing red flesh with pieces of skin hanging like silly flaps from the toes and heels.       "They are not my feet," he said.     "They are your feet,"  said Ernst. "They are the bravest feet in the world," and he bent and kissed each one before lowering them back into the bowl of fresh water.     Maurice watched as he bathed them and lifted them out onto another white towel which he had spread beside the chair.  He sprinkled yellow powder on them and began to wind a long bandage round each one until they were mummified.     Maurice watched him clear away and then pull up a chair opposite.     "I'm sorry."  Maurice mumbled.     "Maurice,"  his words were coming from a long way away,  "Maurice."     Maurice tried to concentrate.     "You did it, you did it."  Ernst had something in his hand.  "Thirty-two miles.  Look,  more than Lutz, more than any of the others."     Maurice smiled vacantly.     "Now bed, rest."  Ernst lifted him out of the chair.  Maurice's head lolled against his shoulder.      He was floating on the bed.  The room was warm and everything was soft.  Ernst took off the shirt and then  cut the trousers that would not pull over the bandages.       "We filmed it all; everything is in the can."  He  stroked Maurice's  head very gently.  "You sat in the car for an hour before I could drive us back.  I had to wait for the speeches and dedication. I had to film that - I had to."     Maurice said words in his head but nothing came from his mouth.       "You could have stopped, anytime."  Ernst's hand ran down Maurice's chest, soothing, "But you did it for me, I know."     Ernst stood up and pulled off his shirt and drifted out of Maurice's vision. Then he felt his warmth beside him, his arms holding him.     His breath was in his ear and whispered like a far sea.  "You suffered  this pain for my honour, for our honour."     Maurice felt the movement against him.     "For your love," he tried to say, but no words come out as the sea carried him into a long black shore where there were only dreams.          						#            'This is my last night.  I do not remember much in detail about the last few days.  I think it is the effect of the morphine.  Ernst had a doctor come and look at my feet.  He rebandaged them and gave me a couple of injections and some tablets.  He came again yesterday, but no more morphine!  Anyway they are not half as sore now.  Ernst, apart from the one day he spent in Kleinz, the nearest large town, has been really wonderful.  He has tended my every need and really pampered me quite extravagantly.  Yesterday afternoon we went for a drive up into the mountains.  Some of the views, even to me, sleepy and sore-footed, were breathtakingly beautiful.  Luckily Ernst has taken some photographs of them, so no need for me to try to describe them, particularly as my poor words could never do them justice.  He also took a photograph of the two of us, he had to sprint back from the camera which he had balanced on a rock, to stand behind me, his hands on my shoulders. I was sitting on a folding chair with a blanket across my knees!   He thinks of everything.  On the way back he suggested we should call the picture, 'The Wounded Comrade'.  We both laughed at that.  Tomorrow Ernst will drive me to Hamburg to catch the boat.  I'm now able to hobble about quite well and the skin is healing fast.  I've had a good time despite the feet.  We have spent a lot of time talking and I now know a great deal about the aims and ideas of N.S.  It makes a lot of sense to me.  I have also heard the Furhrer on the radio.  His accent is a little thick, but he has an amazing way of putting things - very persuasive and straight, none of the ifs and buts we are used to in English politics.  It appears that Ernst's Grandfather has been delayed in Berlin.  He is on the Olympic Committee and there is much for him to do with the opening next month.  I have decided after a lot of thought not to write about the march, just to say I did it, and I am proud of myself,  too.'					#          "Maurice."       Yes?" he turned his head to call back. Ernst was in the kitchen making a meal and he had refused to let him back in until it is ready.     "You can come in now."  He shouted.     Maurice got up, a little carefully.  He seemed to stiffen when he sat, but it was not too bad to walk with the stick. He made his way in.     "Well?" Ernst said..     The room had been decorated with a large Nazi flag, the table was laid out with silver and crystal glass.  Two big chairs had been brought down from the schloss and Hans and Heidi stood by the table.  As Maurice came in they clapped and he felt a blush starting.     "In honour of a hero,"  said Ernst pulling a chair out for him. After Maurice was  seated Ernst sat opposite and Hans poured  each of them a glass of champagne.     "To us - today, tomorrow, forever," said Ernst and despite the sudden lump in his throat Maurice drank. It was cold and delicious.     "Good?"  he asked.     "Exceptional," said Maurice.     "It should be,"  Ernst grinned, "its the best in the cellar."     He turned to Heidi, "Now please," he said and she and Hans went into the kitchen.     "I must confess - I didn't cook it all.  I more organised it really," he said reaching across to refill Maurice's glass.     Hans and Heidi returned with silver dishes and began to serve the two men wild boar, vegetables, cold venison, and chicken.  They ate with gusto.  Maurice's injuries certainly hadn't affected his appetite.  Then came fish, fresh from the lake, then cheeses and finally a huge gateau which Maurice knew to be Ernst's favourite.     At last neither of them could eat any more and the table was tidied.  Hans produced a bottle of '29 Claret and a Schnapps and then he came over to Maurice.     "It is an honour to have served you Herr Vigor," he said and bowed a little.     "Thank you, Hans," said Maurice as the servant stepped back.     "May I wish you a good journey, sir," said Heidi with her little curtsy and then they both left.     "Well,"  said Ernst getting up as they heard them gee-up the horse pulling the carriage that would take them back to the Schloss, "I've got something for you.  He went to the bureau in the corner and returned with a couple of packages.  "You must open them now," he said handing them to Maurice.     Maurice took the flat one first and pulled off the wrapping.  It was the picture Ernst had taken this morning set into a silver frame.     "So that is where you went this afternoon," he said, "To your darkroom.     Ernst just smiled at me.     Then Maurice noticed the inscription across the corner in Ernst's neat, curling hand."To Maurice - Today, Tomorrow, Forever, Ernst."     He felt the lump come back and just managed to croak "Thank you."     "Go on, open the other one."  Ernst said.     The packaging was more difficult, but Maurice finally got it undone.  It was a small case covered with blue velvet.  He snapped it open and there lying on  white silk was a small dagger.  He lifted it out.  There was a bejewelled swastica on the pommel.  The handle was twisted leather decorated with gold leaf oak leaves and the steel blade had "Blood and Honour" engraved along its length.  He looked up at Ernst, speechless.     "It is a minature SS dagger," he said quietly, "And it is yours."     Maurice turned the blade and on the reverse were his initials intertwined, 'MV'.     "How?"  Is all he could say.     "Oh, I have friends who can arrange these things," Ernst said.     "That is why you went to Klienz," Maurice whispered holding the dagger gently across both his hands.     Ernst nodded and came over to his side.     Maurice  put the dagger back into its case and pushed himself upright.  They embraced.  Maurice was too happy for any words.      One of the ship's officers had helped Maurice to the rail.  He  looked around and then he saw Ernst standing by the car.  The hooter sounded drowning out all other noise and then Maurice felt the engines throb as the ship began to move.  Ernst waved at him and he waved back  glad he was too far away for his tears to be seen.  Maurice had promised to come back, next year he hoped, and Ernst planned to visit England.  In Maurice's case were the dagger and the picture, and some books Ernst had given him.  Maurice kept waving until Ernst was too small to see and then he turned, unsteady with the increasing roll of the ship and walked slowly to his cabin.  Luckily, this time he was only sharing with two others so he hoped he would get some sleep.  The ship would dock at six tomorrow.  He would be back in Leytonstone by late evening -  not a thought he wanted to dwell on; there would be time enough for that.                3rd. January 1989.     The phone woke Matthew from his cushions and sleeping bag just after eight a.m.     "Yo, man," Eddie's unmistakably cheerful voice bellowed down the receiver at him.  "Postman's been for you - three letters and one of them looks heavy."     Matthew groaned. "Thanks, I'll be over."  He hung up.     Right.  coffee.  Feed cat.     The orange cat heaved itself up from the foot of the sleeping bag and dug its claws into his leg.       "Alright, feed cat and then coffee.  Wash and shave."     The cat moved over to the fire to wait and  Matthew lit the gas.  Matthew missed a shower, somehow bathing in the morning was not the same.  Perhaps he could get a rail and curtain and one of those mixer hoses.  He scribbled a note to himself to do that and went into the kitchen.     The cat followed to ensure he kept his promise about food.  He took the half full tin from the fridge and scraped the contents onto a plate.  The cat sniffed it and went back to the fire until it had warmed up a little.  Matthew shrugged, put on the coffee and went up to the bathroom.     A little later feeling more alive he sipped his coffee and read his notes from last night.     "So you went to Lunbeck, home of the nasty schnapps and stayed on the Todt estate for two weeks.  His wealth and position impressed you and your dedication and honour impressed him.  Viz the dagger.  You got into calisthetics, racial purity, struggle and world domination and then returned to reality."     He made another note to visit Leytonstone and to have a look at Maurice's old home.     "Then you were at Fenton Street and the M.O.D. from November 1940 to July 1945.  This included a stint in France December 1944 to June 1945.  Holborn again until the autumn.  Then what?"     He made a note,  "When and how did Ernst Todt and Maurice meet again.  What happened 1936 to Fenton Street 1940?"  He made a further note to write to Simms' sister at Posthill, Brighton.     "Right cat, guard the fort."  He put his cup in the sink and set off to collect his post.     "So there's no going back?"  Eddie actually looked concerned.     "Not if this is real."  Matthew passed him the letter.     Eddie read it and passed it back.      "Looks real to me," he said.  "Will  you contest it?"     "What's the point?  Sue wants a divorce on the grounds of irretrivable breakdown of the marriage and she wants half the flat and that's that."     "Have you got a solicitor?"     "I know one who will probably do, but as far as I'm concerned I'll just go along with it."     "Now that's not a very sensible thing to do,"  Eddie refilled the coffee cups.  "I know someone who did that. The divorce itself was okay but the financial settlement left everything open and she came back years latter when he had some money and she cleaned him out.  You take my advice and get a lawyer and get it right first time."     Matthew shrugged.     "That's the attitude that lands you in the shit.  You've got a letter from her solicitor and the photostat of her application.  That's number one.  You've got an open letter from Sue saying what she's doing and asking you to agree to her having half the value of the flat.  That's number two. Now, you get a solicitor and if you write anything, and I mean anything, make sure you write 'without prejuduce' all over it."     "What?"     "It means it can't be shown in court until after the decision is made.  Apart from anything else you could get crucified for costs."     "But I haven't done anything."     "Man you don't have to.  Get a solicitor, pay the man and let him do it.  Say she found out about your old man's shop, she could get half of that if she tried."     "You're joking."     "Do you see my big white teeth?  No, so do as I say.  You haven't told her have you?"     "No.  She still thinks I'm here."     "Then this is where you are man until it's in the bag, got it?"     "Okay" said Matthew, "I've got it."     "And you tell me you're sick."     "I'm sick, certificated sick."     "Lucky bastard, term begins tomorrow with Staff Training.  Wev've got an advisor in whose going to show us how to do Nuffield Science Projects."     "But I thought the physics lab had been closed because of the wiring."     "It has, man, it has.  He's doing it in the canteen."     Eddie laughed until the tears streamed down his face.  That was the great thing about Eddie, - he could laugh.  And when he laughed, you laughed and felt better for it.     A quick call at the cash point on the way back to the shop confirmed the bank statement he had also received that morning.  Matthew made a mental note to change his address with them.  There was no point in them going to Sue's.  He folded the notes, a couple went into his wallet, he pushed the others into his pocket.       The hardware store had rails and mixer hoses. He tucked the box under his arm.  Curtains would be in later in the week.  Two doors down an electrical shop was holding a mammoth sale, according to the poster.  He looked in the window - VCR's were reduced, but still more than he currently wanted to part with.  He hadn't forgotten the 'Maurice money' as he called it, but until it was actually his he was not going to consider it in any calculations.  There was also its possibly less than pleasant provenance to wrestle with.     An answer phone caught his eye.  Reduced to thirty pounds, well, £29.99 and it had a remote call from anywhere facility.  He was still considering it when he found himself back on the street with it in a plastic bag banging against his leg.  Impulse buying!  He must be in a good mood.     There was a small crowd round the front of the shop as he approached.  Well, three people poking about in a couple of trays on legs outside the window which now displayed a large sign in bright red.  'Sale', with 'Buy now, Read later', underneath in green.  Garish, but effective.  Jenny had been busy.  He went inside.  The first set of shelves were also sale titles.  She smiled at him.     "Sold some already. Can you bring the stuff up from the cellar? "she said.     "Where did the trays come from? "he asked.     "I called Jack Dobson and he brought them round, says we can have them if we want; he doesn't use them any more."     "You must have been in early?"     "Saw you leaving," she said.     He dumped his parcels by the desk, "Just the political stuff?"     "Yes, I need to price and  check the novels."     He was about to say, you are keen, but then thought better of it.  She'd probably tired of that joke before she was five.     By the time Matthew had brought the books up, wired in the answer phone - a good thing he'd bought a 'splitter adaptor' with it -  and fixed the rail in the bathroom, he was ready for a shower.    He was pleased to discover that the flat soon warmed up with a fire on, and  going to the window he opened it a fraction letting in more noise than air.     There, by the entrance to the shoe shop alley, stood the tall thin man.  Matthew was certain it was him -  well, pretty certain.  He watched him watching the shop.  A bus passed obscuring the view.  Bad Breath had vanished.  Matthew turned back into the room; perhaps it hadn't been him.  But if it had been, what did he want?  What was so special about the Chasseur  !     The phone rang; it was Jenny.     "A call for you from a Michael Julien.  Could you ring him back urgently?" she read out the number.     That would have to be the next thing - an intercom to the shop, or get the phones sorted.  But like the 'Maurice money', it would make sense to wait until things were more official.     He dialed the number; he didn't know any Michael Julien.  The phone was answered as if someone was sitting on top of it.     "Michael Julien?" he asked.     "Yes,"     "Matthew Vigor - you asked me to call you."     "Yes indeed.  Thank you for your promptness." The voice was soft with a liquid quality that immediately made Matthew think of something slimy.     There was a silence.  Matthew waited.     "I knew your father."  There was another long pause.  "I was at the funeral."  One of the fat hand holders, thought Matthew.  "I understand you now have taken over his shop?"  It was half a question half a statement.       "Yes," said Matthew guardedly.     "Your father had some books for me - special books."     Matthew said nothing.     The wet voice continued, wheedling, "This is very difficult.  The books are paid for, they are mine."     "Yes," said Matthew again.     "They would not be.... obvious."     The voice, the tone, the circumspection, all conspired to identify without specificity.     "Three of them," said Matthew neutrally.     "You found them."  An eagerness overlaid the words.     "They have been destroyed."  And you should have been, thought Matthew.     Silence.     Then, softer, snakish with barely controlled vemon, "I don't think so, no I don't think so."     Matthew waited, there was no point in hanging up much as he wanted to.     "I have," a long pause, "Certain evidence that I will trade for them."     Matthew waited and then said, "Go on."     "You have not told anyone else about them?"  He detected the slight edge of fear in the question.     "No, not yet."     "It would be better for both of us if you keep it that way."     "I will not be threatened,"  Matthew's voice was hard and he fought to control his growing anger.     "No threat I assure you.  Just advice," the words were conciliatory.  "Please bring the books to me.  I am in all day, unless,"  Matthew could hear the breathing, "You prefer me to come to the shop?"     "No," said Matthew immediately.     Micheal Julien gave his address and hung up before anymore could be said.     Matthew sat down feeling unclean and sick.  Evidence?  Of what?  A child pornography ring run by his father?       Despite his revulsion at the thought of it, he would have to go.                Downstairs the shop was not busy, however a few people milled about the for sale shelf and wandered in and out from the trays.  Matthew noted that there was already quite a dent in the pulp politics from the cellar.     "They can't resist a new book for 50p," said Jenny in answer to his whispered enquiry.       "Buy now, read never," said Matthew. "How are the others going?"     "Sold a few, it won't make your fortune though."     "Well worth trying all the same."  He wanted to go into the cellar but he didn't want to make it obvious.  Guilt by association, he thought.  He bumbled about for ten minutes or so tidying shelves and then, as casually as he could, he opened the door and descended.  Now familiar with the lock, the safe opened quickly and he took out the books from the box.  He pushed the door to and then realised that he had nothing to hide them in.     "Anything else down there worth bringing up?"  Her voice from the top of the stairs jerked him upright.      This is stupid, he thought as a wave of irritation coursed through him at being disturbed.  He went to the foot of the stairs.     "I'll check through the other boxes.   Did I leave my briefcase by the desk?"     "Haven't seen it," she moved away from the door.     He removed the box from the safe and returned the books to it.  He looked around.  Nothing but the novels and empty cartons.  He came upstairs and closed the door.  Jenny was at the desk.  She looked up.     "Not here," she said and went back to the customer.     "Must be in the flat then," called Matthew slipping through the connecting door and galloping up the stairs.  He dropped the books into the case and checked the A to Z while his pulse settled back to what passed for normal.     St. Martin's Square was about ten minutes walk along the canal and up towards Primrose Hill.  It was one of those Squares that had, despite the general affluence of the area, remained tatty.  Not that it didn't boast a few Mercedes and a couple of parked Porches, but the tone was still 'undeveloped.'  The south side had been 'creatively restored' and the doors had multiple bells and intercom boxes as portal decoration.  Two houses were obviously about to undergo metamorphosis and were currently clad in scaffolding.  Their windows blinded in plywood and 'No Squatting', notices prominently displayed on their doors.  As for the rest, some were bed sits of the old variety that had not yet shrunk in size and doubled in rent as studio flats while the others presumably housed families.      Matthew crossed the railed and gated green that hosted four large bare plane trees, a couple of benches and an untidy littered shrubbery.  A couple of children on mountain bikes raced around with casual disregard for either the paths or pedestrians.     Number 45 was opposite the gate he exited.  Its paint peeled no more than that of its neighbours and its brickwork was no less dull, but it had an air of decadence that was all its own.  Each window was heavily curtained and there was neither knocker nor bell.  Matthew hammered on the door with his fist and the sound was immediately absorbed to become only soft thumps.  He kicked at the wood, not the first to do so by the bruises in the chipped paint.  He stepped back, no curtain twitched.  He tried again, then about to peer through the letter box he heard a bolt click back and the door opened fractionally.     "Julien?" he said, "I'm Matthew Vigor."    He was let in to the Stygian darkness of the hall.  The door shut behind him.  The smell of baby powder and sweet violets flooded his senses.     "Straight ahead," said the soft voice behind him, "Last door on the right."    As his eyes became accustomed to the gloom  he took in the flock wall paper, the rows of prints in their heavy frames and the visual confirmation of the deep pile of the carpet that silenced his foot fall.  As bidden he opened the last door on the right and went in.     "Sit, please," a hand on his arm chose the chair for him and he sunk into its depth.     Michael Julien sat opposite.       The air in the room was heavy.   A small brazier smoked in the far corner offering up a thin blue trail of smoke to caress the ceiling and walls and then fell lazily to the thick carpeted floor.     Not the fatter one, thought Matthew immediately.  About seventy, perhaps older, shinny face, bald, wet mouth, wet eyes, pink, like a wizzened baby.  Still in his dressing gown and matching deep blue pyjamas.     "So, you have made your assessment and you have judged no doubt and you want to be out of here as quickly as possible."     Matthew said nothing.     "But you have brought my books and in a case I'm sure I recognise."     The more Matthew heard the voice the more he disliked it.     "That you are here, and have them tells me you are both curious and concerned," Julien held up his hand to prevent comment.     "I have no interest in your moral outrage, nor your opinions. I am too old and too well protected while you are neither so I suggest you just listen to me."  He took something from his pocket and popped it into his mouth.     "You have looked at the books so you are aware of my particular predilictions.  As you no doubt have surmised they are very specialist and very difficult to satisfy and I believe you are frightened that your father, rest his soul, was, shall I say, a companion in this arcane profanity or a purveyor for the great profit it generates."       Matthew remained silent.     "For reasons that are not important I will put your mind at rest on both accounts.  Your father hated and despised me and my poor brother, who shares my tastes, as much as you do.  However he is not as pure as you would wish him to be."     "Then why did he...?"     The proscribing hand lifted again.     "Purvey this merchandise?  He didn't.  He obtained it for me as a favour in return for a favour."     Julien lent forward a little.     "You cannot imagine how much your curiosity stimulates me.  No, do not let your emotions lead you to actions you may regret."     Matthew forced himself to sit back into the enfolding cushions, his body still tense.     "I would ask you to remember that society rates the purveyors of such material on the same level as the consumers and should it be necessary I will make it very clear that he did this for profit and that he supplied many others.  If I fall then he falls and he will not fall alone and not just for this."     Julien's voice remained soft, but the limitless cruetly of which it was capable of inflicting on anything weaker than himself showed through.     Matthew knew that his curiosity about Maurice made him weak.     "I met your father, for the first time at Angoulime in Northern France in the spring of 1945.  He was a civilian clerk reporting on German factories. I was in Army Intelligence."     All these years later, thought Matthew, and the class arrogance is still there.     "I met him again, a month or so later in Gelsthoff, Northern Germany, and he wanted a favour from me.  It appeared he had met an old friend from before the war who needed papers to get clear of the mess he had made. A Nazi who needed whitewashing."     Matthew held himself still.     "You should not play poker young man, you give yourself away far too easily.  It appears that something of this is not totally new to you."     "Go on," said Matthew.     "The man was not of interest to us.  He had spent his war on the Eastern Front.  I provided the papers for him and he slipped into obscurity.  However, I took the precaution of getting your father to sign a document implicating him in this deception and exhonorating me.  He had no choice, he wanted the papers and that was my condition, and at the time, that was the end of it.  Then, by a peculiar quirk of fate, many years later I happened to be in Camden Lock, not an area I either care for nor frequent, and I passed a bookshop.  Yes, an Antequarian bookshop whose owner was a certain Maurice Vigor, the same Maurice Vigor for whom I had performed that particular favour."     Julien smiled at Matthew.     "I trust I do not bore you."     "No," said Matthew.     "Good, well as you can imagine I was not as young as I had been and actively pursuing my tastes was not as easy as it once had been.  With age I became more a voyeur if you like.  I approached your father.  Well, booksellers sell books and I wanted certain books.  He obtained them for me.  From where I do not know, nor then did I care.  For your peace of mind he was less than willing, but he still did not want his friend compromised and I still had the paper.s And yes, I still have the papers.  Tell me, which is worse -  a poor sick old man who likes children or a seller of pornography who was a Nazi sympathiser who helped one escape the justice that the world then, and still, demands?"     Before Matthew could say anything the door opened and the fatter man entered and sat on the settee to Matthew's immediate left.  He was a good ten years younger than his brother and his toothless mouth hung open, a thin dribble of saliva wetting his chin.      He was also totally naked.     His body appeared to have no tension at all and collapsed all around him.  His breasts hung in front of him, the nipples dark and thumb sized, his belly fell against the great swell of his buttocks.  But there, grossest of all was his penis.  It lay, a huge dark sausage along the divide of the close pressed thighs while the fat fingers of both hands glided along its length.     "No, no." Michael Julien stood up, "Go back to your room, go back now."  He reached for his brother and took the hands away from their masterbation leading him to stand up and then to walk to the door.  "I will call you, I promise."     Julien returned to the room.     "I would like my books now, if you please.  I shall not contact you again and I suggest you do not contact me.  And do not fear, I have nothing to gain from exposing your father and I trust you feel the same as far as I am concerned."     Matthew stood up, but made no move to open the case.     "There are instructions to distroy any papers I leave on my death if that is your concern.  The secret is safe with me.  I am a man of necessary discretion and I have my poor brother to care for."     He held out his hand.     "The books?"     Matthew hesitated.     "You have a question?"     "What do you know of an Eric Simms?"     For a moment Matthew believed he saw a flicker of knowledge pass across Michael Julien's eyes.     "Nothing.   The name means nothing to me."  The face impassive, the hand still out.     Matthew opened the case and passed the books to Julien.     "I do not think that thank you is appropriate, do you?"     Julien took the books, opened the first one, nodded and put them on the table.     "I will show you out."     "The cold air refreshed, but did not cleanse.  Matthew walked quickly across the square; he could not get away fast enough. As he left the square he thought he saw the tall figure from the bookshop step behind one of the plane trees.  He shook his head - visions he could do without.     He went straight upstairs and flinging the case onto the kitchen table he ran up the short flight to the bathroom.  Despite the lack of a curtain and in disregard of the walls and floor he showered as fully as the restrictions allowed.     Finally wrapped in a towel he went back down to the living room and rummaged in his case for clean, albeit crumpled, clothes.  He bundled the others into a bin bag for the laundry.  He washed his hands in the sink yet still the cloying smell of the violets and the brazier clung to him.     "Jesus fucking Christ!  I need a drink."     There was only the schnapps.  He poured both bottles down the drain and put on the coffee.  He was still shaking.  He sat by the fire fighting to calm himself.     "Come on, it could have been worse, you know that."     But he could have run out, he didn't have to give Julien the books.  He could have just hit him and run out.  But he knew that was not a real option.  Julien still had the paper his father had signed and he would have used it, perhaps gone to the press.  A dead man could not answer back and God knows what Julien could have alleged, even proved.     However Matthew tried to rationalise it.   He felt contaminated and the less for what he had done.  And what had he learned?     That his father had helped a friend, a German who had been a soldier, a Nazi - perhaps one who by the war was less enthusiastic than he had been as a youth of eighteen  escape to the west.       And the price for that act of friendship had been blackmail by Julien.  His father had had to obtain; Matthew shook his head.  And then he had had to supply that stuff to that man.       He sat thinking, unfocused but thinking.     A lot of Nazi's had got out at the end of the war,  particularly those with skills that the West wanted, Verner Von Brun for one.  Others too, many others who could provide names or information about communists or the Soviets.  Later they went into government and administration in the newly functioning West Germany, sanitised and deNazified of course.  It was the same in East Germany - if they were useful, they got away with it.  Only the big ones, those that hadn't been killed or commited suicide, ended up at Nuremburg.     But smaller ones, men perhaps like Ernst Todt, were out of luck, unless they had friends like Maurice.  But what Maurice had done was illegal, very illegal, and he could have been well punished for it.  Typical, what an individual could not do a government could with impunity.  Plus ca change.      Matthew went to the desk and took out the time line.  He wrote,` helped Ernst Todt to the West, next to Spring 1945.`          Later, he went back down to the shop.     Things were much quieter. Jenny was more than happy with the day's takings and most of the sale books from the trays had gone.     "Are you sure Jack doesn't want them back?" asked Matthew.     "That's what he said," said Jenny.     Matthew made a mental note to get him a bottle of scotch.     "We can store them in the cellar if I can get them down the stairs," suggested Matthew.     "The legs unscrew," said Jenny. "They should be no problem."     "I'll put them down there then, may as well do it now."     "The books that are left can go here; there's room enough," Jenny began to push the indoor sale books along the shelf to make a space.  "Do you want me to have a look at more of the journals?" she asked as Matthew brought in the last books from the trays.      "Yes, if your still happy to.  I'll bring down the next one."     "May as well give me a couple and then I can get a general view and go through them in detail later."       That made sense to Matthew, he may as well put the whole lot in the shop desk drawer and let her go through them as she wanted.     He would write to Simms' sister this evening and then perhaps go to the cinema.  It would be good to get out for awhile and lose himself in someone else's fantasy.                     September 1939.     Maurice stood looking out of his window at the dawn.  This was the only thing he liked about his room.  It was  tiny, tucked up in the attic, but it faced the dawn.  It also looked out across what was left of the eastern edge of Epping forest.  From here he could, for a moment, forget the packed terraces of houses that lay all around him. From here all he could see were the trees.  Most of them were old and they could probably remember when James Lane did not cut them off from each other.  Some, perhaps, knew of a time before the Whipps Cross Road broke cruelly into their silvan domain.  Maurice breathed in and savoured the smell of dew damped leaves, flavoured with the musty scent of pale fungi which clustered newborn on the fern and brambled floor beneath the trees. The light breeze which brought the forest into his room fluttered the thin curtains - brushing moth-like against his skin.      This was his time.  His brief, precious time each day that allowed untainted memory, and with the dawn and the forest, it transported and reunited.     He stepped back to give himself room and clasped his hands before him.  Slowly, he pulled hard against his own grip, he raised them above his head as far as he could force them feeling the muscles crack with the strain.  Relaxing, he breathed softly in through his nose and gently out through his mouth.  Now, still clasped together he pushed each palm into the other and lowered them in the widest arc until they come to rest against the dark tangle of his pubic hair.  Today he managed ten before the privy door in the yard banged shut and the hawking cough began. Grandfather had begun his day.       He pulled on his trousers and waited. The smell of hot fat insinuated itself into his room - Mother and Gran had begun breakfast. It was to be set on the table, with the News of the World by the plate. Grandfather stubbed his second cigarette, tar darkened from the urgency of his inhilations against the outside wall, and came into the kitchen still buckling his belt.  Next would be the whining cry of next door's baby and the jangle of the shop door bell as the first customer called for his papers, cigarettes or some other paltry item forgotten in the weekday shopping.     He went down the narrow staircase to the bathroom and locked the door.  The geyser over the bath popped alight as he ran enough water for a shave.  He stropped the cutthroat on the hanging leather and then lathered the brush.  He looked back at himself in the misting mirror as he made careful sweeps with the razor feeling it glide effortlessly over his slightly tanned skin.           It was Sunday.  Today there would be no tedious ride on the 25 bus to Holborn.  No ledgers, no accounts, no piles of papers to check and initial.  Today he would run, row and read.     He emptied the sink, splashed cold water onto his face and wiped a trace of soap from his ear.  It's going to be hot today and he'll wear a short sleeved shirt.  He looked down at his arms, well muscled now despite his slight build, and he allowed himself a smile.     The air in the back kitchen was thick and it caught his throat as he entered.     Mother smiled at him as he entered.     "Rowing?"  She asked pushing his plate towards him across the the green and white checkered linoleum that covered the table against stains.    He nodded at her and Gran.  Grandfather did not look up from his paper; the ash of his cigarette drooped, grey-white and as thin as his hair.       The shop bell, strident in its proximity drew him out to serve, ‘The People’ and ten ‘Black Cat’.  Mother and Gran looked at each other knowing the voice, and the tread through the wall.     "Mr. Woods," said Gran and mother nodded in agreement.  "He's been on overtime all this week you know."     "That's nice," said mother and she poured his tea.     "The bugger only had a pound."  Grandfather sat down again, the ash had fallen off his cigarette on the journey, "Expects me to have change this early."  He riffled the paper in his irritation.     "What did you do, then?"  Grandmother's eyes were sharp as they questioned him.     "Eh?" He grunted.     "About the money," she wanted an answer.     "I put it in the book, what else?"  He turned to the sports news.     "That's alright, then," she said closing the issue.     Maurice stood up.     "You going, then, Maurice?"  Mother looked at him.     "Yes," he said.     "But you've not finished your tea."  Her eyes were bright in the paleness of her face.  She should get out more he thought.     "I've had enough," he tried to smile at her.     "Take your coat.  It may get cold."     "Yes, mother," he said as he closed the door on them and went out through the back yard and onto the strip of common that bordered the lane.          He walked quickly feeling the warmth of the early sun on his arms as he swung them to loosen up.  He crossed the road and made his way through the trees towards the pond.  The family boats were still tied to the island mooring and the main door to the boathouse was shut.  He went round the back and in through the door marked 'employees of the Council only' in poor lettering on a piece of planking.       Ivor looked up from his bench.  He was shaping an oar shaft with long pulls of the spokeshave which he put down as he saw Maurice.     "Couple of hours," he said, the Welsh whine of his voice gave 'hours' three syllables.     "Oh," Maurice said, "I usually can have it all morning."     "Got a friend coming, see, sorry lad."  He picked up the tool and continued stroking the wood.     Maurice hesitated and then decided that two hours was better than nothing and picked up the skiff from the rack.       Ivor limped over to open the main door and let Maurice out.  He heard him slip the bolt back behind him.  Maurice balanced the skiff sideways to the water and lowered it in.  It was so light it barely broke the surface.  He unstrapped the oars and stepped in pushing off as he sat and adjusted his feet in the clamps.  She was a beautiful craft and he appreciated Ivor's workmanship, and the fact that he let him borrow her.  Pulling smoothly, he skimmed across the water raising two coasting ducks to sudden flight.  For an hour at least the lake was his and he could conjure pines around the bank and a summerhouse just out of view.     All too soon the dog walkers and the early couples dotted the shore, their voices carrying brokenly on the breeze scattering words across the rippled water.  He hissed down past the island only to break his stroke as a man and girl splashed and jagged their course - clumsy in the heavy boat, he lounging at the tiller ropes, she inelegant at the oars.  He turned and rested to watch them, his light oars widespread as the legs of a giant insect.  She missed with one pull and fell back laughing, her thin legs pale above the stockings, her skirt blown by the wind.  The man leant forward with a helping hand, his words lost in her shriek of laughter.  Maurice turned back to the boathouse boardwalk now crowded with the as yet unhired bow-tied family scows.  Shadowed in the doorway, Ivor, smiling darkly limped out to head the skiff.     "Just leave there, lad," he gave Maurice his hard hand as he stepped out.  "I'll tie her back a bit, save her being crushed."     "Thanks," Maurice said as he straightened up.     "Not next week, sorry."  Ivor pushed his hands into his pockets.  "I need time to varnish her, see," he nodded down to the bow. "Water's got in, darkens the wood."     "Oh, yes," Maurice didn't let his disappointment show.     "If I leave her the wood'll get soft and we don't want it soft.  Got to be hard, can't do with it soft," and he winked at Maurice.     Maurice left him standing there and walked out westward toward the thicker trees and the less popular paths.  Gently picking up speed, he trotted punching boxer like at the air and blowing hard.          He was well out beyond the new North Circular Road heading for Epping when he heard the bell of St. Angela's clarion noon.  He turned back for home and lunch, served on Sunday in the tight dark parlour that smelt of cold soot and unread books that sat in serried ranks on the polished bookcase they had come with.  A set of Dickens in blue cloth, Shaw's plays in red, and H.G.Wells in virginal maroon.  Grandfather only read the papers.     He cut across the roundabout and trotted along the Whipps Cross Road.  A bus passed, a few heads turned and a child waved, her face pressed against the rear window.  He turned into Poppleton Road and a silence hit him.  Clamping down between the tiled roofs it had emptied gardens and closed doors.  He walked, now uncertain, and came in through the empty shop, the bell now tied back and 'closed' hung in the glassed door.  The silence had come into the yellowed nicotine kitchen and held them in its thrall.  Mother's eyes, red and wet, told him again of her loss, her grief that had become her life.  Her mother twisted her worn hands half in suplication, half in prayer while her husband, cigarette unlit, stared into the yard with his moist lips moving wordlessly.     "What is it?"  His words out of time and place broke the waxen seal of the their memories that held them within themselves.     Mother clutched at him, her flooding tears wetting his shirt, "They'll not have you, they'll not."     A match flared as Grandfather inhaled, "It's war son, that's what it is."     "On the wireless," Grandmother spoke now after her husband, "Mr. Chamberlain says we are at war with Germany."     He lay on his bed, lunch postponed, and stared at the ceiling.  The Fuhrer had made no reply to Chamberlain's ultimatum, and so we have declared war.  He cannot believe it.  Poland attacked Germany, so Germany - just as Ernst had said it would - fought back.  Because of this, they were now enemies.  Because of this, their autumn plans were shattered.  He punched the bed in sudden reasoned anger.  Beside him his Savings Book and  the figures that once held so much hope now mocked him.  He had saved enough, the holidays were booked.  The two last weeks of September.  They were to climb and camp in the Hartz mountains. Now, nothing.  They could not even write.  He closed his eyes, crushing frustrated tears and hearing the blood pump in his ears.     Later he got up and unlocked the wardrobe taking the shoe box of letters and photographs to the bed.  He traced his fingers across the envelopes and then spread out the pictures.       "Paris, July 23rd and 24th 1938."  He whispered the date he had written on the folder.                    					#     I'm standing on platform five, Gare de L'Est.  I've come on the overnight train straight from work. I've taken Saturday morning off on 'compassionate leave', luckily Chapman did not ask too many questions.  Ernst's train is due in fifteen minutes.  I check the arrivals board.  The Berlin train is on time - thank God - we've only got until Sunday night.  I hate to think what I'll feel like on Monday morning; the Boat Train gets into Victoria at six twenty and I start work at eight.     They're announcing it now, there it is.  I can feel the rush of excitement churn my stomach.  I move closer to the barrier, there's no way I'll miss him.  There he is.  I wave.  He sees me and waves back.     "Maurice!"     "Ernst!"     Ours words entwine.  We shake hands then hug for a long time.     "Did you get a pension?"  He picks up his case.     "Yes, no trouble.  How are you, you look tired?"  He does and I am concerned.     "I'm alright now," he says. "Lets take a cab and I'll tell you everything.     I give the address and we settle back.     He wipes his face with a handkerchief.     "Grandfather had a stroke just after I last wrote to you,"  I hear the strain in his voice.     "How is he?"  I take his arm.     "The doctors say he'll make it, but he has to stay in the hospital for a while yet."  He folds the handkerchief back into his pocket.     "Where is he?"     "Berlin"  he says.     So that explains the telegram, 'Arrive Berlin train not Hamburg.'     "I seem to have spent the last couple of weeks travelling between university, the estate and the hospital. I really am exhausted.”  He leans back.     "Poor Ernst," I say, suddenly guilty for him coming to Paris with all he has on his plate.     "Don't worry, it's worth it to see you, Maurice." By his tone I know he means what he says.          We drop our cases on the floor and Ernst collapses on the bed while I run him a bath and call downstairs for a bottle of wine.     I sit on the edge of the bath as he soaks while we both take turns to drink, from the one glass in the room.           "Paris is looking very English," he remarks twisting the hot tap with his toe.     I nod, "The King and Queen were here on Tuesday.  The papers were full of pictures."  And the shops I'd noticed still had displays of English goods and little Union Jacks and Tricolours in their windows.     "I don't think it's a very good time to be a German here."  He turns off the tap.     I shrug.  "Who cares," I say.     He laughs, "Not me certainly."     We are both silent for a moment.     "I bet the papers didn't have the same coverage for your Duke of Windsor last October."  He soaps himself carefully.     "Last October?"  I'm having to think, then I remember. "Oh, the visit.  No, just one picture in the 'heavies' of the Duchess shaking hands with the Fuehrer, and something about them being there to study housing conditions."     "The Fuhrer is not too worried about international popularity.  There are too many important things to do at home."  He ducks under the water rinsing off.  I look away.     "Most comments are not," I hesitate, "very favourable." I finally say.     "What do you expect?"  He puts his hand out for the towel.     "Guernica, Austria, and there are more and more Jews coming into London with terrible stories; and now, all this talk about the Sudetenland."  I'm feeling rather uncomforable, particularly because of the  way Ernst is looking at me.     "I don't think people in England understand." I say lamely.     "But do you?"  His question is direct.     "Yes." I say immediately, "Yes, I do understand.  It has to be done."     He smiles at me and stands up.  "It can't be easy for you, Maurice."     "Not having anyone to talk to about it is the worst thing.  All I ever hear is what people have read or heard.  No one thinks, they just say the same things the papers say."  I think of Grandfather's comment about Schmeling, 'two minutes and four seconds in round one is as long as the rest of the'll last if they try anything'     I run a bath for myself while Ernst dresses.  He comes back in looking much better and very smart in a fresh dark suit in place of the slacks and jacket he had travelled in.     "Well," he is smiling at me, "you are looking fitter than last time, all those muscles."  He feels my arm.  "Mmm, quite an improvement."     "Everday, just as you showed me."  His praise lifts my spirits.     "And are you still going to the meetings?"  They collapse like a hot cake suddenly cooled.     I look down and then shake my head, "No, not after the trouble."     "Trouble?"  He raises an eyebrow.     "Last October."  I say.     "Ah, the South London fracas,"  he leans forward and touches the pale scar on my cheek.     "I got beaten up."  The fear and the embarrassment come flooding back.     "So did Moseley as I remember," he says.     "He was hit by a stone."  I start to wash.     He looks at me for a moment, "You are not cut out to be a fighter, my old friend, and neither am I.  We are thinkers and planners - far more important.  The streets are full of sheep who can do that.  Anyway, Moseley is more a poser than a leader. I think you are wise.  I just wish you could be with me in Berlin; there you would find others like you and I and you would not feel so alone."     His words dispell all the doubts that had begun to creep into my head that perhaps politics had begun to come between us.     "Your time will come." he continues, "Of that I am sure."  Then he takes something out of his pocket and shows it to me.  It is a tiny gold Swastica lapel pin.     "I have joined the Party.  Colonel Dikemann recommended me and it is now sensible to be more obviously connected."     I nod, both envious and proud of him.     "That should upset Kurt Lutz," I say and we both laugh as the old familiarity rekindles and the time we have been apart evaporates.     This is going to be a great weekend after all, I know it.                    				#     And had been.  He looked at the photographs: Ernst under the Eiffel tower, well the legs of the tower anyway; him outside the Louvre; both of us in the Place Pigalle; Notre Dame; the little cafe on the corner of the Rue de la Chat Qui Peche which served the most delicious snacks.  Maurice looked at them all one by one, and then put them carefully back into the shoebox.     War, or no war, Ernst and he will always be friends.  He looked up to the silver frame on his desk, 'Now, tomorrow, forever, Ernst.'       "Yes Ernst," he said, "Forever."     He was suffocating.; they were crushing down on him. He pushed and twisted.  A face swam up to him from the mud, eyes open, lidless.  He tried to scream when the faces jaw fell off and its the skin sloughed into shreds.  He was running through a field of corpses that grabbed at his ankles and he saw his father walking towards him from the photograph, waving.  He tried to wave back but his arms wouldn’t move. A shell burst beside him and he fell, Maurice ran, but could not get nearer.  "Bastard! Bastard!" He heard himself shout but the hands still clawed at him.  "Got no dad, got no dad, got no dad,"  chorused the spitting machine gun fire.  He fell into a crater filled with green water and a red and blue horse that turned into a  bloated clergyman, who patted his knee pushing his hands under his shorts and told him it didn't matter if his mother had no husband because God still loved him.  His tongue was getting longer blacker as it licked at his face trying to force its way into his mouth.  He hit out.  And his hands sank into the clergyman’s chest, green slime ouzed out and he sanks back into the water.  There was shouting and rifle fire. He looked over the lip of the crater and saw men in grey uniforms falling all about him; then, they were men in khaki, then grey, and then there was nothing.  Silence.  The ground was full of holes, tangled wire, and stumped trees.  He got up and walked where his father had fallen.  There was no one but Maurice and the sky felt very close.  He could hear someone crying and ran to him.  His legs were broken and twisted and he didn't have any feet; he opened his eyes and smiled.  Maurice knelt down.   It wasn't his father, it was Ernst.       Maurice sat up screaming.       "Maurice, Maurice."  His door opened and his mother was there, her thin pink dressing gown pulled round her.  She came into the room and put on the light.  "What is it, what's the matter?  She put her arm round him and he could smell her cheap lavender perfume.     "A dream."  His throat was dry and his voice croaked.  The images faded, but the sense of horror was still strong.  He let her keep her arm about him.  "Water," He said, "Water."       She came back with a glass from the bathroom and he drank feeling better.     "I'm sorry," he said, "I'm alright now, really."       She bent down and kissed his head.  "It's the news," she said, "Just the news."  And she went out softly shutting the door behind her.     Maurice stayed sitting up for a moment, his pyjama top was soaked with sweat and the sheets and blankets were all twisted.  He got up to shake them straight and to change.  He climbed back into bed leaving the light on.  He was wide awake.  He got up and took his journal and a pencil from the drawer.  It's half past four.  There was no point in trying to sleep now.                                                             June to October,  1940.     Everyone was talking about it and the papers were full of pictures. They were back from Dunkirk.  Maurice felt it was pretty amazing, all those little ships.  But it meant we were out of France and he could not see her lasting long now, on her own.  Perhaps Grandfather had been right, you could not trust the French.  Belgium and Holland had had it, so had Denmark and Norway.  At least Chamberlain had gone, not that he liked Churchill any better, full of wind and words.  He wondered where Ernst was and if he was alright.  Perhaps he was at Dunkirk.     "Your tea's getting a scum on it."  He looked up from the paper, Lilly was grinning at him like a stupid monkey from the other side  of the desk. He ignored her.     Edward had been a bit of a pain when he had been here, but he had gone now.  Still, he had preferred him to Lilly.     "Why weren't you called up?" was the first thing she asked him the day she came to replace Edward.     "I was," he had said.     "So why are you still here, then?"  She never knew when to stop asking questions.     "Because I was medically unfit."  He had  told her.  "I have a T.B. scar on one lung.  He didn't mention the flat feet.     "Well you look fit to me," she said.     "But you're not a doctor, are you?"  That had shut her up for a bit.     Maurice just wished it were easier outside the office.  Most men his age were now in uniform and sometimes he felt people looking at him as if he shouldn't be here in civies, but there in uniform.  Still, he thought, there's not a 'there' to be now, but no uniform was still a problem.  Perhaps if he limped a bit they would think he had been at Dunkirk or something and was wounded.  He couldn't really pretend to be a foreigner anymore either, not with  internment.  He had heard that old Lehrman had been taken and that Mosley was in prison, too.  That still worried him in case someone had his name from the times he'd been to the meetings, but he didn't think that was too likely.     "Haven't you finished with that paper yet?"  She reached across the desk to poke at the back of it.     He turned slightly sideways so she couldn't reach.     "I just want to see what's on at the Gaumont."  He could see she was pouting.  Lunch break was nearly over so he tossed the paper across to her.  He thought that all she ever did was go to the cinema.         There was the slightest of clicks and Mr. Chapman's door opened.  He put his head out and looked at the clock on the wall; it said twelve fifty-nine.  He looked at it for a moment and then across at the rows of desks, and then went back into his office.  He would be out again in one minute and woe betide anyone with a newspaper or lunch box still on his desk.     "Damn," whispered Lilly rudely and shoved the paper in her drawer. "That's your fault," she said to Maurice. "Now I'll have to wait until tea break."     "Sorry," he smiled at her. Now she'll have to think about something other than film stars for the next couple of hours.     He opened the folder just as Chapman came out to have his little walk around.     The afternoon dragged on.  Outside, Maurice could just see a patch of sky between the roofsI looked like another bright warm day as if the weather was making up for the early part of the year.  January had been so cold he had nearly frozen to death on the morning bus rides and he’d had to do his exercises with the window shut.  He really did hate the cold and wet.     "Another lot, love,"  Mrs. Anderson dumped a wire cage of receipts on his desk. "Keep you going for a bit."  Then she waddled off pushing her trolly to the next row.     He split the pile and handed half across to Lilly.     "If them Nazis ever get here, we can always smother them with paper,” said Lilly.     For once he had to agree with her.  His drawer was stuffed with Public Information Leaflets, Air Raid Instructions, Civil Service (WAR) Emergency Regulations and God knows what else.  It had taken long enough for the war to actually get started and when it did it was all abroad, and all we got was papers and Regulations.  Not that he was actually complaining.     "Maurice", it was Lilly again.     "Yes?"  She had a file in her hand so this time it could be work.     "The yellow sheets missing."  She flapped the thing at him.     "The SC/213 you mean," he said.     "Yes, the yellow sheet.  What do I do?"  The papers slipped out on to the floor and she bent to pick them up.     He could make a suggestion he thought to himself, but, "Give them here," is what he said.     It took him a minute to put them into order again and the SC/213 was missing.     "Okay, I'll take them to Mr. Chapman," he said with a sigh.  With luck he would deal with it otherwise, he'd be chasing round for hours and it was nearly time for tea.     He knocked and went into the office.     "SC/213 missing Mr. Chapman," he handed him the file.     He flipped through it to confirm what he had said.     "So it is, Mr. Vigor.   Are you busy?"  He looked up at Maurice over his half glasses.     "Yes sir," Maurice answered truthfully.     "Hmm, then leave it with me," He put the file carefully on his desk lining it up with the edge of the blotting paper. "I will make the necessary enquiries."     And so, dismissed, Maurice went back to his desk.  Thinking that he way Mr. Chapman handled the matter, you'd think a sheet of paper; second copy; of, 'Toilet Tissue / Requisition / VAD Southwark, missing; presumed lost, would make a vital difference to the whole war effort.     Maurice's  tea had arrived, in both cup and saucer.  He emptied the saucer back into the cup and pulled the next file from the pile.     "I've seen them all."  Lilly had folded the paper in the drawer and was reading the listings through the crack.     "So stay home," he said.     She gave him a dirty look, "You don't meet people at home," she said.  "I think I'll go and see Ninotchka again.  I think Melvyn Douglas is really dishy.  Looks a bit like you, but older."     "Well I can't say the same about you and Garbo."  He said and she didn't speak to him again for the rest of the afternoon.     He walked back from the bus stop practising a gentle limp.  There were a few more children playing in the streets. Some of the evacuees had returned, and they looked happy to be home again.          The shop was still open. Grandfather was counting coupons   He looked up, then licked his fingers and began counting again.  Maurice went into the kitchen and sat down.  He was  tired.      "Cup of tea," mother pushed the pot towards him. "It's freshly made."     Tea was always ready in that kitchen.     Grandmother came in. She had been up to the allotment.  The whole of the back common had been turned over to vegetables and nearly everyone in the street had a strip.  Her basket was dumped on the table with its burden of cabbage, carrots and a couple of bunches of miserable raddishes.     "I'll swear someone's had some of our stuff," she said pouring herself a mug of tea. She jerked her head towards the shop door, "E in there?"     Mother nodded, "Counting coupons."     Grandmother snorted and sat down.     "Well it's better than him messing about with all those boxes," said mother.     Maurice had gotten used to them, but his mother still worried in case the police or the Council man came round and asked too many questions.  There were about ten of them stacked up against the end wall so you had to squeeze past to get out of the yard door.  It was easier coming in because the door opened against them.  There were at least another twenty in the cellar and he had even stacked some in the Anderson shelter.  God help them if they ever have to go in there.  It was the rationing that had started it.  Just a few at first, and then it sort of built up.  Someone Grandfather knew someone who got them from a man in Wapping.  Maurice reckoned they've come out of the docks, but it didn't do to ask questions.  They were full of tins, fruit, corned beef, butter, you name it and there were tins of it.  For special customers only, of course, and no coupons.     "I got sod all out of the last war so I'm getting something out of this one."  Grandfather had said when mother said she didn't like it, and that was the end of it.  There was no moving him when his mind was made up.  Especially now that he had started to roll his own and smoke less.  "I'm not paying eight pence halfpenny a packet for fags," he had said.  Now he smoked Old Holborn which smelt like a garden bonfire and even made Grandmother cough. She must have breathed as much smoke as he had over the years.     "You do look pale Maurice," said mother, breaking into his thoughts. "You should try to get out in the evenings.   Don't you like to run anymore?"     "Too tired," he said.       How could he explain to her what it was like being noticed all the time, having comments made about you behind your back.  He was the only one of his age in the street who was not in uniform and it had become  worse since Eddie Wilson had been killed when the HMS Darling went down in Februaury.  He had been the first from round here, and there's been two more since then.  Funny that both of them lived in Applegarth Drive down by the station.     "They keeping you busy in that office, then?"  Grandmother was washing the carrots in the sink.     "Boring more than busy," he said taking his cup to the draining board.     "Lucky to have time to be bored.   Don't know you're born you don't."  said Grandfather coming in to take a couple of tins from the box by the grate.  "In a safe job, with a pension at the end of it, bloody lucky I'd say.  Thirty five years I did and not  even a thank you.  Now I've got to serve in this bloody shop every hour God send's just to survive."  He slammed the door on  his way out.     "Just to survive," said Grandmother. "I've seen his savings book.  If that's surviving them I'm a Dutchman."     "He's getting worse," said mother quietly. "You can hardly get a civil word out of him these days."     Maurice went up stairs leaving them to their grumbling.     He could not settle.  He had read for a couple of hours, but his mind kept wandering.  Where was Ernst and was he alright?  Maurice was also disturbed by some of the things he had read in the papers about what was happening in Poland and and in Germany itself.  He was sure a lot of it was propaganda and untrue but he had to confess to some uncertainty.  He knew and accepted that the Jews and Communists had to be eradicated, but if what he read was true, why need it be so brutal?     He went back to Wodehouse and tried to get lost in the elegance of his language and the purity of his style which Maurice really admired.  Words had always been his haven.  If he did not have books to read he often thought that he could not go on.  He put the light on and then got up again to pull the blackout curtains right over the window.  Across the street someone was listening to Lord Haw Haw.  He heard the drawl more than the actual words, it was an unmistakable voice.  He had heard Joyce once on the platform with Mosley.  He hadn't really had much to say, but he had made an awful lot of it.     He went back to reading but it was no good.  He wondered if he should have gone to Germany?  But then he would have been a traitor, not that he felt he owed this country anything.  What had it given him?  Nothing.  It had taken his father, cast his Grandfather aside when trade went slack, denied him education because of his poverty, and means tested everything to protect the rich from taxes.  But to have gone to Germany?  No, he knew he couldn't really ever have been comfortable with such a situation and no one ever trusted such a person however committed they might be.     Finally Maurice decided to have a bath and then to turn in.  He  wondered if Lilly might have something after all.  Perhaps he should go out some evenings.  Even if all he did was go for a walk round the West End, at least he wouldn't feel so caged up.     He  could see it on his desk from the door as soon as he came in.  A long blue envelope.  An internal Civil Service memo, he had had one when he was made a permenant clerk.  He opened it carefully glad that he'd got in before Lilly who'd be full of questions and comments.       He read the few words, but they didn't sink in so he read them again.     'Maurice Vigor -  report to Section 3C, Room 212, Ministry of Defence, 10 am. today.'     He looked at his watch, seven fifty-eight.  He'd better see Mr. Chapman and let him know.  His mind was racing.  He could walk there in about forty minutes from here, or get a bus to Trafalgar Square and then walk down Whitehall. As he thought that to himself he suddenly felt sick.  He sat down as his legs almost gave way.       Oh God, it's because of those meetings, or Lehrman, or Ernst.  He stared again at the memo searching for clues that weren't there until his eyes burned and he could see the fibers of the blotting paper and the fuzzy edges of the typed letters.  Fear twisted at his stomach, his mind accused him, you're guilty of treason, they, someone knows how you feel, and with a war on?  That's treason.  He had to go to the toilet.     "I see you have received the memo."  Mr. Chapman was right behind him.     "Yes sir," he managed, now desperate to go.     "Leave at nine."  Mr. Chapman turned away to check the late comers.     He didn't say anything about coming back.  Maurice rushed out colliding with Lilly as she ambled in totally unconcerned at being two minutes late.     "Why don't you look where your going. You nearly had me off my feet," she said as he come back in.  "Ohh, you're as white as a sheet!   Are you sick?"     She actually sounded concerned.     "Something I ate,"  is all he said pushing the memo into his pocket.     "Tins," she said  You never know what's in them these days.  My mother says they're putting awful in them."     "Offal," I said, "Not awful."     "Yes, well, I bet that's what made you sick."  Then she saw Mr. Chapman and she started moving papers about on her side of the desk.     The next hour dragged and Maurice couldn't concentrate.  He kept thinking of what he could say and the sort of questions they might ask him.  Then he had a thought.  If it was really serious they wouldn't send for him.   They'd have the police here, or have come for him at home. Surely!  That made him feel a little better.     He really hated being out on the street mid-morning on a working day.  He knew people were looking at him.  He knew what they were thinking, “not only not a soldier, but not working.”  They must think him a loafer, a waster, an outsider.  A criminal.  Maurice felt sick again.       He turned into Longacre.  There were six men in uniform coming towards him, laughing and joking, taking up the whole pavement.  He slipped quickly down a side turning to cut through Covent Garden.  What if they spoke to him, said something?     "Why ain't yer got no uniform?"         What could he say?  What answer would be enough?  Medically unfit - who really believes that unless it's obvious?     He was beginning to sweat now.  If only the old man hadn't called that out after him that morning.     "Why ain't yer got no uniform?"     He had stuttered, half replied, half lied to the old medal wearing paper seller and had gone to the bus stop by a different route each morning ever since.     He kept walking, eyes down.  He knew he didn't even want to be in uniform.  That made the questions and the looks worse.  He knew he wasn't a coward, but doubt had an insidious way of waiting, pike-like in the darker recesses of a mind, waiting for the right moment, moments like  this to surface and snap at his fears.     Whitehall was sandbagged and part-tressel barriered as he crossed through the slow moving traffic.  Two policemen, despite the heat,  in their high collared uniforms and toy like in their syncopated movements, slowly shuttled vehicles between them and away from Admiralty Arch.  Obviously something was going on.  Probably, he thought, to do with the aftermath of Dunkirk.  Or even to do with the rumored threat of invasion.  What if England fell like France?  Where would he stand in an English Vichy?  Were there others, too, who felt Germany should not be the enemy?  Or was he alone?     There were fewer cars and pedestrians now, as he passed Horse Guards and the Colonial Office.  Just ahead of him a bowler-hatted, dark-suited man with a brief case bulging wontonly against his leg stopped suddenly, putting the case on the pavement.  Maurice drew level with him.     "I say, is it much past nine?"  The redness of his face was amplified by the shock of greying hair now visible as he lifted his hat to wipe his forehead with a large light blue handkerchief.     "Ten to ten, sir." Said Maurice without needing to look again at his watch.     "I knew I was going to be late; I knew it."  He shoved the handkerchief back into his pocket and drew out a crumpled sheet of paper.  "The first interview was at nine thirty."  He heaved up the case and walked along beside Maurice.     "I do so hate to be late, but there's so much to do and so little time to do it in, don't you think?"  He said puffing slightly.     Maurice had no idea what the man was talking about so he just nodded.     "And what time were you called for?" The man said out of the blue.     And Maurice replied, "Ten sir," before he realized the import of the question and the correct assumption the man had made.     "Well then Mr. Vigor, we can talk on the way and be done with it and I can sort of catch myself up, as it were." He looked at Maurice with  unfocused eyes.  "You don't object to that, do you?"          Maurice sat on a bench staring at the wall of the embankment and the buildings across the river, but he was not seeing them.  He was trying to make sense out of the last fifteen minutes.  He was dripping with sweat, the heat, fear, the talk, or, more like, interrogation, he'd just been through.  Now he knew why it was called a grilling and he certainly felt 'well done'.  He felt naked, gutted like a Billinsgate fish and he didn't even know what he had been called for.  The man had asked questions, Maurice had answered, asked little and had been told less.  The man, it appeared, already knew much about him.     "I know the facts," he had puffed, "What I want to know is the man behind those facts, I want to know you."   'Did he like Mr. Chapman?  What did he think was the value of the work he was doing?  What was it like at home?  Did he like to travel?  What had he thought about Germany in 1936?'       Maurice had tried to be careful with that question, especially when the man had said he could be totally frank with him.  Maurice had tried to be, but he didn't say more than appeared appropriate.     'Did he like France?  Did he have a girlfriend?  What did he like to read?'     As Maurice went over it in his mind he couldn't find any pattern.  He had not been asked about Lehrman or the B.U.F. meetings.     The last question had been the hardest.     "Why did he think he had been called to the interview?"     He'd said, "I have no idea, sir.  Is it to do with my work?"      The man had smiled at that, "Yes, something like that."          Maurice had never even gotten to get inside the building far less to Room 212.  He felt let down, almost cheated.  He shivered as if the proverbial goose had walked over his grave.  What had his parting words been.  Maurice  thought carefully.     "Well, thank you for coming Mr.Vigor, and don't look so worried.  There's no problem at all.  You'll hear from us."  And with that he disappeared inside the building and Maurice hadn't.     Maurice stood up.  Well, that's that whatever it was.  He began to walk back, then seeing a Holborn bus, he hopped on, relieved that it was over and almost glad to be going back to the familiarity of the office.      Maurice lay staring up at the ceiling.  He was tired, not in the usual sense of needing sleep or rest.  He could handle that sort of tiredness.  This was a tiredness of the soul.  That was how he had described it to himself in his journal - a tiredness that came from, he had struggled to identify the cause, unbelonging.  Unbelonging; being, being there, but not being a part of; different too, yet present; there but not there.  Yes, he knew the fears, the hopes, the reliefs of his countrymen as the news charted what they were allowed to know of the war.  Yes, he knew, too, the thrill of the whispered words, the urgent touching and the transitory relief afforded by the dark doorways of the blackout.  But their promise soon palled to an emptiness that  was part of his unbelonging.  Put more simply, Maurice was lonely.  He covered it by flippancy, of thought if not word, by work and more work, and by a certainty that he would survive this current lunacy of war.       He swung himself off the bed as he heard the throb of the engines, One Elevens, he thought - unmistakable sound.  He switched off the light and opened his curtains and the window.  By angling himself tightly in the left hand corner of the window recess, he had a reasonable view of the east and southeastern aspects of the metropolitan skyline.     The bright fingers were already up and groping the thin clouds for a Dornier or a Heinkel.  Their packs of Ack Ack barked frantically and spat steel into the high night more in hope than in certainty of aim.  The heavy crump of the fallen bombs and the spreading, crackling red fire spoke of someone catching a packet tonight.  From the direction, Maurice thought, it was either Silver Town or the Isle of Dogs.  It was the docks they were after.  If they're on target, a thought flitted by as a flash lit up the room, it might cut the number of tins in our kitchen.....       "Maurice!"  Grandfather called out from the foot of the stairs.     Maurice said nothing.     "Maurice, you bloody fool, are you up there?"       Grandfather was getting wound up.     "Your mother's crying."     Maurice  doubted that.  Somehow she seemed to be stronger now than he could ever remember her, especially since she got in with the WVS crowd.     "I'm not coming up for you."     That sounded like his last attempt.  Maurice waited and there were no more calls.  Grandfather had either given up, or decided that Maurice must be out after all.  He went  back to the window. He couldn't handle the shelter.  Four of them in that corrugated box was just too much, especially with him and her bickering half the night and his mother clicking away at jumpers or socks or whatever.       He'd got caught in one of those public shelters up West a couple of nights ago.  In some ways they were worse.  Fancy catching one and perishing along with a crowd of strangers who will insist on striking up banal conversations when all one wants to do is read until they let us out.  And they smell, sweat and urine and old cheese.  Now there's a mystery, where does the old cheese smell come from?       Maurice's mind continued to wander as he watched the devouring glow pulse and flicker with the wind carried crackling that accompanied the distant muffled beat of the bombs.  A smell of burning crept into his room.  He flinched involuntarily as the Ack Ack unit round the back by the nearby school sought out a lone straggler.  Off they go, like a pack of dogs - one barks they all bark.  He finally closed the blackout and turned on the small light he'd fixed up over his bed.  He would just lie there and let himself drift off to sleep.       That was closer.  The room shook slightly, probably a stray being chased by a night fighter and dumping as it ran for cover or the coast.   Well, the wars on our doorstep now, as it has been most nights since the end of August. He wondered how long it would go on for?  It had been a funny summer, too.  Work was just the same.  He'd never heard anymore after that 'chat' in Whitehall, but he did get a promotion, so that was probably what it was all about.  He'd now got four Lilly's to keep an eye on.  Actually two Sallys, a Jean and Lilly, but they were all the same, though 'Lilly One' was now engaged to a Canadian pilot who seemed to spend more time in the West End with her than he did in the air.  Maurice supposed he was lucky.  We lost a lot this summer.  So had they.  At least the Invasion was off, so we are told.  He was glad Ernst was not a flyer, though he didn’t know that for certain.  But he did know Ernst would survive. He didn't know why, he just knew.     Memories mingled with half sleep.     He turned over pulling the covers around him. It was quietning down.  The 'all clear' wound itself up, a weird sound like the howl of an injured animal.  He fluffed up the pillow, the rats would be crawling out soon.  Dawn would not be long.     He hoped Ernst was not in Berlin.  Seems the RAF plastered them last night if you can believe the paper.  He looked out of the window.  Aldgate.  It's seven forty-five, he was going to be late.  He could walk faster than this. They lurched to a halt.  Now what?  He looked out of the window. Hopson's Fruitshop has had it, just a shell and still smoldering.  The Masonic Lodge had gone.  They really had taken a pounding round here.     "Oh my Gward."  The voice came from the back of the bus.     He turned round with the rest of the passengers.  The old girl was pointing.     It was the warehouse.  There, second story, something was moving in the smoke.     "There's more of them."  The man in front of him was pointing.     Everyone was speaking, suddenly drawn out of their insularity.     "Where?"     "There, look."     Maurice peered into the smoke trying to follow the weak jet of water trained on the charred window by an exhausted looking fireman.  There was a sudden glow as the flames flared.  There was someone in there.       "Three of them."  The man next to him grabbed his arm in his shock.  "Look, one's waving.  Oh God1"     Maurice's stomach turned.  The flames are all about them.     The bus jerked backwards and he grabbed at the seat.     "The wall's going."  He didn't see who called out.     The bus stopped again.     There was a loud sigh more than a rumble or a crash and the end wall of the building collapsed back into the flames.  He could see a section of the floor burst outwards flinging the bodies up into the air.  A flaming torso arced out and bounced into the road just ahead of them.  A woman screamed sharply, then there was silence.     The fireman turned his hose onto the body which twisted and hissed with the force of the water.  Maurice saw the metal of the stand.  Another fireman pushed the dummy into the gutter and the bus started forward again.     "Oh my Gward."  It was the old girl again.     He could feel the relief sweep through the passengers.  The shocked silence was broken, the horror swept away by the release of laughter.  He joined in.  For a moment he was one of them, laughing, joking, and alive.       He should have recognised the building.  Selfridge's clothes warehouse, hundreds of dummies not bodies, were stored there.  No wonder it had burnt so well.  They bumped over hoses snaked across the road and turned into the City.     It was half past eight before he climbed the stairs to the office. Mr. Chapman was standing by Maurice's desk.  He must live in that office.     "I shall expect your desk cleared by Friday," Mr. Chapman said, his face and voice without expression.     I'm only half an hour late thought Maurice immediately, and it's the first time.     "Your successor will want to start with a clear slate,"  he looked at Maurice with his dead-cod eyes.     "Successor?"  Maurice said stupidly.     "This job doesn't end just because you are leaving, Mr. Vigor."     He looked at Chapman blankly.  He was making no sense, he couldn't be sacked for lateness.  He was a permanent clerk and there was a war on. Defiance and defence struggled for primacy on Maurice's face.      "Your transfer, Mr.Vigor, to the Ministry of Defence," Mr.Chapman said finally with infinite patience written all over his voice.     "I am sorry Mr. Chapman," Maurice said, "I have no idea what you are talking about."      "Are you telling me you have not been notified?"  Disbelief had now replaced patience.     "Notified?"  Maurice believed he was beginning to sound like a parrot.     Mr. Chapman turned on his heel and walked into his office.  Maurice sat down then looked round.  Two Joans and a Jean are at their desks.  No Lilly.     As Mr. Chapman re-emerged, Lilly came clattering in.  Her handbag, sandwich bag and gas mask case crunched against the desk as she struggled to unhook her coat from the broken edge of the cane wastepaper basket and to take off her hat at the same time.     "Morning Mr. Chapman," she chirped. "Terrible on the bus, there's an unexploded bomb at Kings Cross and we had to go by Will's Street."  She freed her coat and sat down winking at Maurice.     Mr. Chapman handed Maurice a blue memo.  He read it quickly and then re-read it slowly.         "I know nothing about this," he said quietly keeping his voice steady.     "You should have been notified by post," Mr.Chapman is obviously incensed by the failure in communications.  "Have you moved?"  There was a hint of hope and accusation in his voice.  It could be Maurice's fault after all.     "No sir, " Maurice said, absolute and absolved of any blame.     "Most irregular," muttered Chapman.     It had to be someone else's fault, but the thought that the Civil Service or the Post Office could be to blame is difficult for him.  "Then let me be the first to congratulate you on your transfer and promotion."  He stuck out his hand and Maurice stood up to shake it, uncomfortably.     Lilly's face was a whirlpool of curiosity, she liked to be the first to know everything, and usually was.     "Thank you, sir," Maurice  said.     With less than a quarter of his service, he was, as of next Monday, only one grade below Mr. Chapman.     Chapman stood, uncertain for a moment, and then turned and went back into his office.     Maurice looked across at Lilly.     "Tell me," she ordered, "Where are you going?"     "I don't really know," he said honestly, still too stunned to make a wise crack. "I'm to report," he looked down at the memo that has been left with him, "To Fenton Street on Monday."     "Oh," Lilly put her hand to her mouth in genuine surprise and if Maurice could judge her looks, awe.  "That's boffins and research."     Why is it, he thought, women always seem to know much more about what is supposed to be secret than men ever do.     "My friend Joan works there," confided Lilly.     So, he thought, the source revealed.     "She says its very nice there."  She leant over the desk conspiratorily, "Very informal. They can have tea when ever they want to."  Her highest accolade had been bestowed upon the place.     "Oh," said Maurice, still dazed by events.     "There's only four men in the office, and her.  It's very hush hush, they go all over the country and she says they get their orders direct from Mr. Churchill himself."     She sat back, her eyes wide at the very thought of it.     "Well," said Maurice at last, determined to play it down, "I'm not going until Monday and we've a lot of work to clear by then.     Despite his resolution, the news was soon all over the office and he had congratulations and questions to fend off for the rest of the day.  In some ways that was not difficult because he knew nothing about Fenton Street, nor why he had been transfered.     He decided to say nothing at home, certainly not about the extra money which was more than he had started on as a junior clerk.  He also didn't see that they needed to know, after all, there was a war on and careless talk cost lives.                                                                              November 1940.     A ginger biscuit arrived together with a lump of sugar for the tea.  Joan put her finger to her lips and nodded in the direction of Horace who was now hidden behind his newspaper.  Only the thin, but constant column of blue smoke rising toward the high stuccoed ceiling and the intermittent paper-trembling cough indicated his actual presence.  He hadn't said a word for the last fifteen minutes.  Joan returned with his tea and biscuit, but Maurice didn't see any sugar.     "Sugar?"  He didn't lower the paper.     "We're out."  She winked at Maurice and went back into the kitchen and clattered around.     He sipped his sweet tea and looked out of the large Georgian windows, through the criss cross of tape over the panes, across the tree lined street to the stone and brick houses opposite that mirrored and repeated number 17 Fenton Street.  Once this must have been, like its neighbours, the town home of some minor nobility, or gentleman, or perhaps just a successful merchant.     He looked around the room taking stock.  This would have been the main reception room, perhaps a ballroom?  Certainly then it would have been more elegantly furnished.  Now the floor had only a worn grey carpet part covering the polished boards that showed themselves through the thinness where the desk legs and constant tread had rubbed away the pile.  The walls, pale blue paint over wallpaper - he could see some peeling up in the far corner - are themselves covered with maps, directives, documents and exhortations.  But the room was light and airy and he felt quite at home.       "We are on the second floor," Joan said as she led him up from the reception desk in the hallway.      He'd had to ring the doorbell to get in.     "Cellar shelter," she had pointed to a door marked 'Shelter'.  "Ground floor is the canteen for us, and next door, top floor is something to do with the Free French Liaison Group."     They climbed, clattering on the bare stair boards.     "Empty. Empty," she jerked her thumb at two small rooms. "My kitchen."  He had noted the propriatorial tone, "And that's your desk."     And he'd been sitting behind it for the last hour twiddling his thumbs.     Horace's cup and saucer clinked.  Maurice looked up.  The hand groped for the handle, found it, and both retreated back behind the paper.     Joan was still in the kitchen.  He could hear a typewriter, she must use it as an office too.     "Getting bored son?"  Horace lowered his paper.     "No, not really," Maurice looked out of the window and watched the last few leaves spiral down from the upper branches to join their brothers rotting on the thin grass at the foot of the tree.     "It isn't always this quiet, you know," Horace sounded defensive.  "Sometimes we're so busy," he can't find a suitable example so he dissolved into a long coughing session that caused him to withdraw a tatty handkerchief from his trouser pocket and wipe his eyes.  "Well," he finally said, "When the files come in they comes in a glut."     "Yes," said Maurice his eyes follow a squirrel as it sprints up the trunk out of his view.  He turned to face Horace, "I don't mind at all.  It's not how much you are doing," he paused, "But how important what you are doing is."     "You're right there Mo.  Pity a few others don't appreciate that."     Maurice wished he hadn't started calling him Mo.     "'Ain't that right, Joan?"  Horace called out.     "What?"  The typing stopped as she appeared at the kitchen door.     Outside a motorbike chugged up, coughed and stopped.     "That's them," Horace folded his paper and brushed the ash off his desk.     Joan was already down the stairs before the doorbell clangged bluntly somewhere below them.     "Right," said Horace cutting the string that tied the parcel Joan had dumped on his desk.  "This is what you've been waiting for."  He came over to Maurice's desk.     The typing had started again and Maurice heard the motorbike chuff off down the street.     Horace put a small white card down on the desk directly in front of Maurice.  He half sat on the corner of the desk; his yellow stained right index finger tapped the card as he spoke.     "That, my son, will move mountains and even open the doors of Hell itself." He pushed the card toward Maurice who picked it up.    "For God's sake, don't ever lose it and if you do, then do the decent thing and top yourself."  His laugh disintegrated into a cough requiring further use of the handkerchief.      Maurice picked the card up and turned it over.  A head and shoulders photograph of himself looked back from the left hand corner.  It was embossed with the stamp, 'Min. Def.'  A crest and the full words 'Ministry of Defence', ran across the top of the card, then underneath was his name, and in curly script 'is to be afforded all help and assistance he may require.'  Underneath was the most powerful colophon of the war, the signature of the  Prime Minister, Winston Churchill.  At the bottom was a Whitehall telephone number.     He looked up at Horace.     "Now, my son, you are one of the team.  Official so to say, so I can tell you what you do."  He was grinning, probably Maurice thought, at the look of stupifaction he felt had spread over his face.     "We're out of E-12's," shouted Joan from the kitchen-office.     "Then go and get some," said Horace raising his eyebrows, "Go with her, Mo; she hates the spiders.  I'll fill you in when you get back."  He stood up and went back to the pile of buff files on his desk that had come with Maurice's ID card..     Maurice went into the kitchen.     "Cellar," said Joan getting up. "It's dusty and horrible down there.     He followed her down the stairs.     There was a bunk, some chairs, an old table, only one working light bulb and a row of locked filing cabinets against the far wall.     "Here," she gave him a key, "Second one, top drawer.  Take about thirty of them."     He did so, blowing the dust and a few old webs out of his way.     "What's an E-12?" he asked.     "Requesition forms," she said keeping by the door.     "For what?"     "For anything, I suppose.  Horace never even looks at them; just scrawls his squiggle on the bottom," she answered. "Have you got a brief case and travelling things?"     "Like what?"  He relocked the cabinet.     "Shaving, spare socks, you know."     "Will I need them?"  He was not really sure what she was on about.     "You will," she pulled the door behind them. "Leave it to me.     They went  back up the stairs and he dumped the forms on her table dropping a couple.  As he picked them up he slipped one into his pocket.  Could be useful, he thought to himself, and there's more than thirty in the pile.          Horace beckoned him over.     "Now," he said, prodding a file, "This has come from the Cabinet Office and you can see that it has an 'Action' column on the front."     Maurice nodded.     "Right. I decide who gets it, you or Ted or George.  And before you ask, that depends on where you are at the time or where else I've already got you down for,so you don't have to race all over the Country.  Then, you go to where it says and do what it says and then bring the file back to me.  Simple."  Ash fell onto the file and he brushed it off.     "Then what happens?"  Asked Maurice.     "Then I give you some more  and off you go again," he tossed the file back onto the pile.     "I mean to the file," said Maurice.     He lit another Woodbine from the 'almost deceased’ one in his hand' and flicked the stub into the ashtray.     "Well, if it's a continuing live file it goes back upstairs; if it's a dead file it goes to the Registry.     "What's the Registry"       "A bloody great hole in the White Cliffs of Dover, or somewhere."  He sat down.  "Any questions?"     Maurice had so many he didn't know where to begin.     "Look," Horace said, "It's common sense really and it tells you what to do on the file.  You'll get the hang of it."     Maurice went back to his desk, still puzzled and looking it.     After lunch Maurice returned to his still empty desk.  Joan had given him a magazine, and Horace, still at the pub, had left his paper.  He flicked idly through them.  The canteen wasn't much, sandwiches and a few pies and tea that came by van.  It's was more just a place to eat them out of the office, than a real canteen.  Today Joan and he were the only ones there.  But at least he had learnt a little more from her about the 'goings on' at Fenton Street.      It appeared that those in the field, as she put it, have the 'clout' to get things done.  If research is being held up by bits of red tape or local difficulties, then we go to sort it out.     "It's all in the file," she said, "You organise transport or men or whatever the 'boffins' want and the file says what they can have.  That's what your card is for - to get things done."     And as far as he could gather from the other things she said, field operatives also make sure that any research no longer considered worthwhile by who ever makes those decisions, is in fact stopped and the men and materials reallocated...     "According to the instructions on the file."  They had chorused when she'd been through it all a second time.     Maurice still didn't know though if they were the only three men doing this, and neither did Joan.     "If Horace knows he's not saying," she said when he asked her.  "Keeps a very tight mouth, does Horace.  Even I don't know where Ted and George go."     Well, he thought, if Joan doesn't know then nobody does because she seems to know everything else - except of course the very things he wanted to know about his new job.  Job! He'd really done nothing all day, not that he was complaining as such.  It's just that one can get very bored and fidgety if there is nothing to do.       "Mo."     Maurice looked up.  He hadn't noticed that Horace was back.     "It's gone four, why don't you push off, there's no more you can do today."     "O.K." Maurice, wished he'd said please don't call me Mo, but he'd left it too late and now Joan was calling him that too.      He got up, "Eight or earlier?" he asked.     "Nine'll do tomorrow and don't look so sad about it.  You'll be busier than you want to be soon enough."  So Horace coughed his orders and goodbyes,  and then Joan yelled “cherio” and he was back out on the street.     Maurice hadn't gone three hundred yards when it hit him.     He wasn't limping and he'd just walked past two Army Captains.  One of them had actually moved aside to let him stay on the narrow pavement at the end of the street where it goes into Cadagon Square.     The realisation stopped him in his tracks.     The Card.     Tucked firmly in his top pocket, it exuded a power that gave him the right to be in civies, wherever he wanted to be at any time of the day and night, without explanation to anyone.     He walked on.  Better than any uniform, more potent, more mysterious, he could feel it enlarging and validating his inner self.     "Maurice Vigor, Ministry of Defence," he said quietly to myself imagining the various ways he can produce the card.  Quickly, authoritatively from his top pocket, fumblingly, almost apologetically from his inside pocket, casually offhand from his side pocket.  He felt himself smiling.     He will buy it a small case, black leather, subtle.     It's really been a good day after all.  A very good day.          He was crossing Cadagon Square and it was five to eight on day three.  He hoped there would be more to do today.  Yesterday he had spent collating forms and reports for Horace, work that could have been done by a junior typist at Holborn!       As he turned into Fenton Street he could see the vans outside the office. He quickened his pace.  The door was open as men and boxes flowed up the stairs and he flowed with them to the second floor.       "You can't move in here," Horace waved at him as he came in. "Mo, can you shove your desk right over by the window."     Maurice did so.  George's desk was already jammed up next to where Horace put him.  The photo of his wife and the larger one of his dog had both fallen over and Maurice stood them up.     "Laundry was hit last night," said Horace, I've been here since five.  It's impossible. You can't get all their stuff and three more men in here."     "They're going in the two back rooms and it's only temporary," said Joan handing out tea to anyone who stood still long enough.     Maurice was desperate to know what the 'Laundry' was, but he could see he was not going to get the opportunity to ask.  He spent the next half an hour moving boxes and then the vans were gone and a crowded silence settled on the place.     "When are the men coming?" he asked.     "God knows," said Horace, “but you're out today so read this up and see Joan before you go."  He thrust a file at Maurice and vanished into the back room where Maurice could hear voices half raised in mild dispute.     He squeezed in behind his desk and opened the file.  Albion Tractors, Biggleswade, he was to oversee a move to larger premises and to ensure there was minimum loss of production.  He read on.  One thing was for sure they were not making tractors, however there was no indication of what they were making.  He closed the file.  Joan was standing beside him and Maurice noticed a perfume he hadn't noticed yesterday.  He said nothing.     "Train's in an hour from Kings Cross.  There's a fiver in the envelope and get receipts for everything.  You're booked in at the Swan and this is for you."  With that she dumped a cardboard box on his desk and went back into the kitchen.     Maurice opened the box.     A black leather brief case, MOD and crest.  Toiletries and shaving kit, a leather bound Gazeteer of the British Isles and a small heavily reinforced, sealed cardboad box.       He stared at them.     "Get a move on, Mo," Horace had come out of the back room, "And ring in if there's a problem."  He picked up a file and went out again.     Maurice shoved everything into the case, collected his overcoat and hat and went.     The Swan was rural, no, rustic, as was the whole village.  The train pulled into the station, bedecked with flower beds and hanging baskets and disgorged one person - him.  He inquired as to the Swan and found it to be in easy walking distance.  En route he passed the Albion Tractor Works; no wonder they needed larger premises, unless they were into miniaturization.  He doubted if they could get even one tractor into that tiny shed!     "Ah, Mr. Vigor, from the Ministry," Mein host had an accent as flat and inviting as the land all about the village, naught but mud and brussel sprouts. "You'll have room three.  Will you be needing a car, sir?"  He almost leered at Maurice; "Most of the Ministry men want a car to Old Warden, the Training School, that is."     God knows how we keep any secrets in this Country!  Thought Maurice.     "Thank you, no."  Maurice replied to Mine Host's obvious disappointment. He probably has a connection to the local car hire business.     "Very good, sir," Mine Host managed.     "But I will take lunch," said Maurice  and turned away trying not to laugh at a joke even he couldn't explain.     The room was large, warm and comfortably appointed. He dropped his case on the bed and went over to the small sink.  May as well tidy up before he ate.  The price had looked most reasonable after London, and rabbit pie would be a first for Maurice - not quite wild boar, or lake fish, but country enough.     After lunch he'd go up to the works and see what he was supposed to do.       Dr.Watts was a thin, worried-looking man of about forty to forty-five whom seemed inordinately pleased to see Maurice.     "Mr. Vigor, you have no idea how glad we are that the Ministry agrees we need more space."     His voice was hesitant and reminded Maurice of the American actor James Stewart.    "There is no way we can make more sights without more facilities."     So that's what it was, thought Maurice, now at least I know what it is I'm facilitating.  Tank gun sights - now the file made more sense.  What surprised Maurice was the ease with which he could assimilate the problems facing the little company and appreciate why the Ministry had listed the various possibilities which may solve them.    It was really only a matter of standing above them, he thought, and then looking at which of the alternative solutions could actually be applied at ground level as it were.     An afternoon with Dr. Watts and about an hour on the telephone saw much achieved.  Maurice was amazed at the way in which people were willing to do what they were told, when told firmly enough.  "Vigor, Ministry of Defence, you have unused capacity...excess labor...power lines to be connected...plant to be moved.... have your lorries and men here in the morning”...and so on.  All he had to do was sign papers that would later go for payment.  Once he had collated these papers, hour by boring hour - in peace and in war, now it was he ordering them and making the decisions.  'Vigor, Ministry of Defence', and in his pocket was the white and powerful pass.     By six there was little more he could do that day.  He would go back to the Swan, review the afternoon, plan tomorrow and relax.            At last, alone after a reasonable meal in the lounge with three other men, none of whom spoke.  He sat by the fire in the lounge nursing a half pint of the local Wells and Winch beer and then realized that he had no clean socks for the morning.  He would wash them and hope they would dry.  As soon as possible he must obtain socks, underwear and some shirts for such journeys as this.     Finishing his drink he went up to the room and ensuring the door was firmly locked her eased his feet from his shoes and drowned his socks in the sink, after giving them a good rub with the tiny peice of soap that had been thoughtfully provided by Mein Host.     He pulled the easy chair up to the one large radiator that gurgled and hissed quietly along the wall, settled himself comfortably with his feet up on the bed, and pulled the Albion file from his case.  He re-read the notes and then added his own comments on foolscap blanks that Joan had given him.  So engrossed was he in the work he didn't notice time passing until a knock on the door jerked him back to the room and the present.     "Yes?"  he called going over to the door.     "Supper tray, sir," a flat female Bedfordshire voice answered him.     Remembering his naked feet just in time, he quickly pulled on his shoes and then unlocked the door.   Puzzled - he had not asked for supper - he opened the door to a crack.     She stood there in her black uniform and slightly off-white pinny, her silly cap perched on her floss of unruly brown hair.     "With Mr. Gray's compliments, sir."  She stood blank faced holding the wooden tray covered with a cloth.  "And what time do you want to be called in the morning, sir?"     "Six thirty will be fine,"  he looked at her still uncertain about the tray.     She pushed the tray towards the door, "He does this for all the Ministry men, sir."     Maurice opened the door and took the tray from her.     "Will there be anything else, sir?"  She stood, relieved of her burden, yet unmoving.     "No, thank you," said Maurice and pushed the door shut with his foot.     He put the tray on the bed and as he relocked the door he heard her walking away, heavy footed, down the corridor.     Quickly rinsing out the forgotten socks, he hung them on the radiator and hoped they would be dry for the morning.  The tray, uncovered, revealed: a slice of cold rabbit pie, two pickled onions and a mug of what looked suspiciously like cocoa with a very thick skin.     Cocoa was one drink Maurice could not even bear to think about without a strong feeling of revulsion and it was down the sink before the sight of it blunted an appetite brought up by the slice of pie.     He was two good bites into it and brushing crumbs from the bed cover when he remembered the heavy little box in his case. He withdrew it and balanced it on his lap alongside the plate.     The box had no marking and was sealed with a strong tape that took the edge off his penknife.  Inside, wrapped in heavy grease paper was a flat, point three-two automatic pistol and two clips of ammunition.  For a moment the pie was forgotten.     He looked at it for a few moments, then quickly finishing his supper he freed and cleaned the automatic of its protective coatings.  It lay in his hand, small, heavy, dull, menacing, powerful, exciting.  Issued to him.  He didn't ask why, he didn't think why, he didn't care why.  This was his.  With such a weapon he had power over those who did not.  He thought of school taunts uttered, and indignities suffered, and let his imagination rewrite new endings until he went back to eating the pie and reality.            He had fired a pistol before, not very accurately he had to confess.  Ernst had been much better.  That had been a Luger - much bigger, not half as secret as this one that would slip into a pocket and not be noticed.  He sat with it for a while, then, carefully loading it and unloading it he wiped it with the spare hand towel and slipped it into his case.  If he needed it, he knew where it was.  If he needed to, it could be in his pocket, or under his pillow.  He took it out, checked the safety and put it under his pillow.  He would remember it in the morning, that was for certain.  He put the box and wrappings in his case, he would dispose of them later.  Time now for sleep, exercise in the morning, breakfast and back to tank sights.                    Three days later the new premises were ready for the plant to be moved in.  Production would stop for about five hours, but could be caught up by extra work and the new men, more men would come next week.  Dr. Watts was pleased, more than pleased.     "If there were more like you at the beginning we wouldn't be in this mess now.  I'm pleased to shake your hand, Mr. Vigor, and I shall write and say so."  Maurice didn't expect him to, but it didn't matter.      He paid his bill at the Swan, plus a small tip to Mein Host for the suppers - why not - and returned to London.      Walking back to Fenton Street he felt a slight collapse of the elation he had previously experienced.  Yet what more had he expected of his first assignment?  He could not say. He had achieved what was necessary; he had used his new authority.  Hi s hand almost unconsciously touched his top pocket, had it been too easy?  No one had challenged him, no one had asked to see his pass. W he had shown it to Dr.Watts, it had been almost brushed aside as if it were obvious and unnecessary.        He turned into the building.  Something had changed.  The door was open, but a booth and desk had been set up to cover the entrance way.  Behind the desk sat a superannuated concierge in uniform.     "Can I help you?"  He had started out of his chair as Maurice approached.     "Maurice Vigor," said Maurice amused by the incongruity of being questioned on his home ground.     "Third floor?"  He asked.     "Second," said Maurice as the man ran his finger down the list on the desk.     "Ah, yes, Mr. Vigor, second floor.  Thank you sir,"  he pushed a register towards Maurice, "If you could please sign in, sir."     Maurice did so, passed back the pencil to the new security, and went up stairs.     "Joan."  He stuck his head in her kitchen-office, "What's with the guard dog?"     "Its all that foreign stuff in the Laundry, everyone's got to sign in and out now.  Have a good time?"  She was obviously pleased to see him.     "Yes, fine, no problems, and thanks," he smiled at her.     "That you, Mo?"  Called Horace.     Maurice went into the main room.   Order had returned, albeit somewhat cramped, but files and boxes no longer spilled over the floor and tables.  Horace looked up at him.     "Alright?"       "No problems."  Maurice gave him the envelope with the change from the fiver and the receipts.     "Just write it all up then, Joan will type it for you, stick it in the file, and let me have it back.  There's,.."  Maurice waited for the coughing to stop,  "...Two more on your desk."  He went back behind his paper.  It appeared that Maurice had made the grade as far as Horace was concerned.     And so began the basic pattern of Maurice's new life.  Despite the often long and tiring hours of travel with their frequent delays and the occasional less-than-acceptable-lodgings, Maurice enjoyed his work.  Now and then he remembered the trotting red-faced man who had seen something in him, understood and had recommended his transfer to this job that he did well.     But despite everything there was still an emptiness.  In his journal he tried to find the focus, the hollow centre of himself that sucked the joy out of life.  He wrote of his loneliness, his distance, his dream that he could not articulate because it was shrouded from him by his own shadow.  And in writing of himself and to himself he found both some  little succor and a growing confirmation of his difference.     At work Joan's increasing attention began to irk him.  He had been grateful for her help and not wishing to make the mistake he made with Lilly, he was willing to be friendly, he could be no more than that.  It was clear for her that this was not enough.  She would stand close by him while he wrote, bring him choice biscuits that did not reach Horace or anyone else as far as he could ascertain.  She would always have news to tell him, time to sit on the edge of the desk, to brush his shoulders of stray hairs after a quick visit to the barbers, to type his notes up first, and then to ask him to the cinema.     "Garry Cooper's in a film with Madeleine Carroll at the Carlton.  I could book seats."     Horace had been listening. "North-West Mounted Police."  He said from behind the paper.  "It’s rubbish, I wouldn't bother."     Joan made a face in his direction and tried again later when he was out.     "We could go to the Regal and see Henry Fonda."    Maurice wished he'd said no, but he had run out of excuses.  He also felt a certain guilt at not wanting to go out with her, not finding her attractive when it was obvious to anyone else that she was.  Finally, he acquiesced, graciously, and they made their way to the seven fifiteen showing.     She held his arm throughout the whole performance and even kept her leg close to his.  In the street afterwards, on the pretext of fearing to stumble in the blackout gloom, she still held onto him.     He walked her to the station conscious that everyone was watching him with a girl on his arm who was chattering on and on about the film they had just seen.  His embarrassment became anger and his anger turned and twisted as he sat on the bus as it crawled eastward.  She knew his life, what he did and where, when he was out and when he was in, and he felt invaded.  He had to go back to the office in the morning and pretend he had enjoyed it. What if she wanted to go out again?  She would want to, and to refuse would be difficult, even impossible, now.  He felt sick and trapped and utterly miserable.  And there was no one to tell no one to talk to except himself and his journal.       The next few days were not as bad as he had feared, apart from a wink from Horace that accompanied a knowing look in Joan's direction, though he made no comment.  Joan herself made only a brief reference to their outing, and to Maurice's relief there was no suggestion that it might be repeated.  She did, however, maintain her 'Maurice first and best policy.'      The first Tuesday in November was his birthday.  He had said nothing, but there on his desk was a card from Joan.     "I haven't said anything to Horace," she sat on the edge of Maurice's desk. "But birthdays are special and, well, we are friends, aren't we."  She passed him  a small package, smiled and slipped back into her domain almost colliding with Horace who had just come in from the back room with an arm full of files.     "Can you believe it, Mo?"  He dumped the files on the floor raising a cloud of dust.  "This lot should have gone off weeks ago."  He lit a cigarette.  "Any tea in this place Joan."     Maurice dropped the card and package into his case.  "Important, are they?"  He asked looking up.     "Should have gone to the Registry. God knows how they got in there.  No harm done. Give us a hand to check them through and they can go with today's batch."     The tea arrived while Maurice was still on the floor surrounded by open files and collating slips.  Joan handed him a cup and then returned with a small peice of cake on a saucer.     "What's all this then?" said Horace prodding the piece she had given to him.  "Are we celebrating?"     Joan lent over the desk, "No, just carrot cake from home, but if you don't..."     "No, lovely," said Horace. "Must be my lucky day."     Maurice said nothing; it could have been accidental.  But Joan had known he was there on the floor and she could have been teasing him by showing so much of her legs, or taunting him.  W had she given him a card?  He drank his tea, his mood uncertain for the rest of the day.A trip to Swansea filled in the rest of that week and the first part of the second for he was not back in the office again until Wednesday the thirteenth.  The good mood he arrived in was further enhanced by Joan's absence.  He sat down and began his write-up of the dispersal of the team. Until his visit they had been working on low light target enhancement that in the committee's estimation was making insufficient progress.  The team had not worked well together and their breakup had not been regretted. Most of the men were happy with their new assignments although the team leader had taken it as a personal criticism.  He had tried at first to intimidate Maurice and to obstruct his access to the laboratory.  Maurice merely called upon the Senior Scientist and had the man removed; no one wished to put further funding from the Ministry at risk.  After that Maurice continued his task unobstructed.      In fact, he was discovering that his quiet, imitatively hesitant voice combined with an iron sense of purpose that he would make immediately visible whenever necessary, produced a most satisfying alacrity of positive responses. He was learning about power, drawing into himself the authority of his position, albeit within the narrow confines of his work.     He was also learning about opportunity.  And of the darker side of his own nature that he had long suspected through fantasy.     He had missed the eleven twenty back to London.  The next train would not be coming through until one.     "Its goods train mind you," the station porter was trying to be helpful, "But you see the guard and you can travel with him, seeing its official like, change at Bath."     Maurice was grateful.     "Well, I'm off home, still some fire in the waiting room."  And with that the man had locked the ticket office and left.     Maurice pulled the collar up on his coat and settled down to wait on the now deserted station.  He must have been half dozing because he was suddenly awake aware he was no longer alone.       There!  A noise, clumsy sounds coming from the other platform.  He looked at his watch.  Nearly half past twelve.  He stood up, stiff from sitting and looked out of the window.  In the half shadow of the single light a figure staggered towards the toilets at the end of the low buildings.  Maurice had caught a brief glimpse of blonde hair, rumpled clothes and of a pale, delicate child-like face.  Sudden desire flooded over him.  He walked quietly out of the room and followed the boy into the unlit toilets.     The sailor must have been drinking quite heavily, probably more than he was used to and he swayed in to lean, glassy-eyed against the urinal wall. Maurice felt no need to hurry, the prey was unconscious of the hunter's presence.    Maurice watched him from the sink - he was young, no more than eighteen, small in stature with a simple beautiful face, deep dark eyes and short blonde hair. He appeared to have lost his cap.    The boy fumbled with the buttons of his flap and then precariously balancing himself aimed a thick yellow jet against the crazed white porcelain with a sigh of relief.  Maurice forced himself to look away.  The sound stopped.  He looked back, his breath tight in his chest.  The boy had swung slightly sideways.  His hand still holding himself, he tried to draw himself upright.  He failed and grabbed at the stall with both hands, his trousers slipped revealing light glistening hairs and his heavy, part-engorged penis arcing toward the floor.  Maurice felt his throat dry and a tightening in his stomach.  He backed out onto the still deserted platform.  Desire became lust, adrenalin demanded he act and act now. He would do it. He had to do it and he was ready.     Inside, defeated by the buttons, the boy had made it halfway into a cubical that would at least give him privacy and a place to finish the last of the rum.  Maurice came quickly up behind him pushing him forward, bringing his case inside, and kicking the door shut all in one move. The boy tried to turn suddenly shocked into sobriety as he felt Maurice's hand grasp at his penis  rubbing and jerking.  He twisted his head back his mouth open to cry out, his eyes widened in terror as the short cold barrel of the pistol cracked against his tooth and cut into his lip. He could smell the intensity of purpose in his attacker and feel the cruel need hard against his buttocks. The hand continued more intimate, more forceful squeezing and pulling, pressing and circling, drawing clear fluid to lubricate  Maurice's will.     Sobbing soundlessly the boy was bent and crushed against the wall as Maurice entered him.  In and in control, Maurice felt deified, all powerful, eternal and he came in pumping spasms that shook and heaved them both.  He pulled out, softening quickly with the cold and the completion of his act.    The boy had defiled his uniform, had allowed himself to be taken, he had let it happen.  He was a sailor, he was unfit to serve, and in battle would be dead. Reason gave Maurice justification, justification absolved guilt.    The boy slid between the pedestal and the wall half-raising an arm against the expected blow or bullet.  Maurice stepped out of the stall pulling the door closed.  He went to the sink and waited, the pistol ready.  From the cubical came the sound of vomiting and the clink of a bottle on the tiles.  In the distance he heard the train whistle.  Washing his hands, he straightened his tie, checked himself in the dim mirror, slipped the pistol into his pocket, picked up his case and went out onto the platform.  Shame would keep the sailor silent     The guard was happy to have someone to talk to, Maurice could make a seat on the sacks.     "Mind your clothes though but, they’re got oil on ‘em those sacks have.  Drop of tea?  Tin mug mind, it's hot."  The guards accent was heavy     Maurice pulled on his gloves, Joan's present; it was the first time he had worn them.  The train rattled its way towards Bath and the London connection.  Maurice drank the hot tea, grateful and smiling.        "Any problems with that one, Mo?"  Horace had a cup of tea in his hand.  Maurice shook his head.  "Want a cup?" He went on, "It's do it yourself for a bit now since Joan got her papers."     "Papers?"     "Three days after you went to Wales, boyo.  Joined the WRAFs.  Didn't she tell you?"  He called from the kitchen. "She left you a note, made me promise to give it to you."  He reappeared with the tea, but no biscuit.     Maurice took it.  "Do we get a replacement?"  He wasn't sure he wanted one, but then he didn't want to type or make tea either.     "Due today, but no sign of her yet."     "Who is it?"  He was curious.     "No idea, no papers come through, just a memo to say she's coming."  He took an envelope out of his desk draw.  "Here's your love letter you lucky man."  He spun the blue missile at Maurice who caught it deftly.     "Thanks  You read it?"     "Don't be daft."  Horace didn't look insulted.  "Go on then, what's she say."     "Later."  Maurice stuffed it into his pocket and went back to his report.  Horace grinned, lit a cigarette and erected his paper.     No one arrived on the fourteenth or the morning of the fifteenth, except for the silent unacknowledged and unacknowledging visitors to the Laundry.  They would come in, walk into the little room on the right, reappear after a while with a packet or small parcel and vanish down the stairs.  The two men who ran the Laundry were rarely seen and said little when they were.  They always looked grey harrassed old and tired as if what they did would condemn men to die.     It was just before eleven when the phone rang on Horace's desk, he listened long without comment.     "Right, thanks.  No, just send any papers and stuff back.  Oh, right.  Then just leave it then."  He hung up.     "George bought it last night."  Horace stood up and went to the window.      Maurice had met George a couple of times - small precise, about fifty, and unremarkable. His was the picture of the wife and dog on his desk.     "Where?"     "Coventry.  They caught a packet and he was at the engineering works with a night shift.  Nothing much left."     "How..?"  Maurice left it unsaid.     "One of the AFB found his case, saw the cypher and handed it in."     "Never rains, but it pours.  Tea?"  Horace's anodyne to everything.     Maurice got up. "I'll make it."  Horace had known George for a lot longer than he had.          That night Maurice tried to write in his journal.  George's sudden death had upset him.  It was the closest Death had come to him. Yet more than the loss of George, he himself was on his mind, he and his act of rape.  Not guilt, well, not directly guilt.  More the deepened sense of lonliness it had brought him.  The thrill had now long passed and left only a sense of defilement.  The act without sharing had no value.  He had taken, he had violated, and he was the less for it.  He wrote, but was not cleansed.      George’s attaché case and Fran, Joan's replacement, arrived at the same time, but from different places.  Fran had been in records at Wembly, was of indeterminate middle age, pink, supportive, quite short-sighted even with glasses, and reminded Maurice of a mother sow.  She was also very efficient and even better than Joan had been at liberating those tasty, but rare tidbits that relieved the grayer parts of winter days.     "I've got friends at the officers clubs all over London," was all she would say in her faint Midlands accent when pressed as to the origin of the latest delicacy.     The case, still locked, had a hardness brought about by the heat and it smelt of bonfires.  The handle had gone and there were scuff marks on the back as if it had slid a long way in a hot wind.  The files inside were dusty.  Horace wrapped the personal items and put them in the drawer.  Two files were worked on, and had pencil notes on the covers in neat script.  The third one was to have been done on the way back.       Horace passed it over.  "Here, Mo, you can do this one in a day, up and back.  Kings, Cambridge, see a boffin called Simms, Eric Simms.  Its all in the file." November to December 1940.       Simms was not to be found at Kings; he was working at the Cavendish Laboratory.     "His rooms are here sir."  The gate porter was helpful, "But, Doctor Simms is working at the laboratory.  He spends most of his time there now, just across the road, to your right."   He came out to point the way.  "Just there, you can see the turning."  Maurice thanked him.      It was only a few minutes walk and as this was his first visit to the town he was happy to look around, though a strong wind cut coldly from the north-east.  The sky had taken a leaden sheen and had lowered itself to almost brush the tops of the building.  It would probably rain, it may even snow.  He was grateful for the warmth of the gloves and for the scarf wound about his neck with its tails spread across his chest - like a front only waistcoat.  At the corner of Downing Street a gust tore at his overcoat and forced him to hold the brim of his hat with his left hand.    He wished the colleges and laboratories were marked with a name; it was confusing with only crests or latin mottos for identification.  Beating  up the street he wondered what it must be like to have the money to study here.  He had read of the privileges, the panelled rooms, the hall diners, and the leisurely punts on the Cam.      "Excuse me."  He stopped a woman basketed and billowed going before the wind.  "The Cavendish Laboratories?"     "You've just passed them, my dear."  Her skirt and coat flapped impatiently about her.  "I'll show you."  She sailed on and he bobbed behind.  "There, that's the door."     His thanks were blown past her as she tacked across the road and was gone.     He turned in up the few steps and through the half glass doors into a small hall guarded by a pedantic medal-wearing septuagenarian porter who appeared to also be deaf.     "Who d'you say?"     Maurice repeated the name, twice.     "And he has facilities here?"     Maurice confirmed that he did.     "You have an appointment?"     The letter that had been sent to Eric Simms informing him of the impending visit had been in the name of George Riley, the name the porter had written on the visitors’ badge which he had prepared and was still clipped to his visitors board.     "He's not expecting you, Mr. Vigor.  No one is allowed in here without an appointment.  Dr. Simms is especially strict about that."       Maurice took out his pass; the old man peered at it.     "Signed by Mr. Winston Churchill himself, eh?  You must be a very important man."     Maurice agreed that he was, however his name was not on the porter's visitors’ list; therefore he was not expected and so he was not coming in - on this point the porter was adamant.  Maurice pointed again to his pass, to the wording, and to the prime minister's signature.        "I don't care if its signed by William Ewart Gladstone himself, your name's not on my list and that's final."         The old man was getting very worked up by now and Maurice was becoming irritated. However, he was aware that the most powerful totum on earth has no power to he who does not recognise it.  The stalemate was resolved by the arrival of a third party.     "G'morning Dr. Howlett."  Said the porter raising his right forefinger toward his head.      Maurice spoke quickly explaining the situation.  The porter listened carefully to Dr.Howlett then stabbed at his list with the same salutary forefinger while vigorously shaking his head.     "Age destroys the flexibility of thought as well as bodies," said Dr.Howlett softly to Maurice.     "Jenkins, I want to sign," he looked at Maurice, "Mr.Vigor," repeating the name Maurice had given, "Into the Lab.  Do you have a blank?     The old man nodded and handed him a blank visitor's label which he immediately filled in for Maurice. The old man then handed the board to Maurice.     "Will you sign in please Sir."  Maurice did so.     "Thank you, sir."  He retrieved his board and the two men went on into the corridor beyond.     "Jenkins is a good chap, really; been with the university over sixty years; just a bit slow."  He tapped his head.  "Who was it you wanted to see?"     Maurice said whom.     "Ah."  The tone was indicative of something.     "What's he like?"  Maurice took up the invitation to receive an opinion.     "Oh, first rate scientist, definitely; first rate; yes, yes, no question."     "But?"     "Well, odd, difficult man to talk to, very moody, well wrapped up. "     "In his work?"  Instantly Maurice wished he had not interrupted.     "Well, yes, that's it, in his work."     They turned a corner and the passage became stairs.     "My lots’ upstairs; Simms is the first door at the bottom.  Sign out when you leave old chap or I'll never hear the end of it from Jenkins."            Maurice knocked, turned the handle, found it locked, and knocked again, louder. Eventually he heard movement on the other side of the door.     "Who is it?"  The voice was impatient.     Maurice gave his name.     "Who?"     Maurice had visions of another porter in there, this time in a white coat with unruly hair and mad, staring eyes.     "From the Ministry of Defence."  He shouted.     A lock turned and the door opened.     "I only sent the letter yesterday.  Come in.  This is wonderful.  Excellent."  He was drawn in and the door was locked behind him.  The speaker was still holding his arm.  "Come over to the bench.  You can see it there, it really works.  Did you bring the valve?"       "Dr. Eric Simms?"  Maurice was unsure.     "Yes, yes, I'm Simms." He was about Maurice's height, about his age, or perhaps a year or two older, with straight black hair brilcreamed flat and thick heavy glasses that dominated the pale childlike face.  "You do have it?"  He was sounding concerned, "It has been approved?"     Maurice did not know what he meant and said so.  Simms threw his hands to his face in frustration, and began to pace to and fro muttering to himself.  He was obviously under a great deal of stress and he appeared to be close to some sort of breakdown.Maurice pulled out the file and placed it on the bench.     "Your work has been approved and the equipment you requested is in,"  He looked at the date. "As of April, this year."     Simms turned on him.  "April. April!  It,s now  November.  I've moved on! I don't need this, "He jabbed at the file, "I need a Mullard valve. I wrote to the Ministry, it’s in my letter."  He seemed close to tears.     "Why don't you explain it to me?"  Maurice asked.     "You?"  Simms stopped and looked at him, puzzled.     "Well, I'm from the Ministry, you tell me and I can tell them."     The logic appealed to Simms and he began to explain what he was doing.  Maurice stopped him.  What Simms was describing was not what was listed in the file.     "I know that, it won't work, but this will if I can get the valve."     The fact that what he was now doing had not been authorised was irrelevant to him, and  Maurice could not make him understand this.      "It can't go on."  He said sweeping the file back into his case.     At that moment Simms looked at him then crumpled against the bench, his head in his arms, his shoulders heaving.   Suddenly, Maurice saw was a young, brilliant, exhausted scientist who was obviously misunderstood even by his own colleagues and he felt a strong sense of kinship sweep over him.  He moved beside him, hesitated and put his hand on Simm’s back.     "I'm sure there's something we can do."  Maurice spoke softly.  "Come over here."  He led him to a chair by the blackboard and sat him down.  Maurice pulled a stool up next to him. "Why not take the equipment, write up a report, and then put in a request for this valve?  You're work has been approved so any further equipment should be, don't you see?"     Simms nodded. "I'm sorry."    "Thank you. I just get so tired, sometimes it all appears so pointless."     "Your work is important.  As important as any soldiers, but like mine it doesn't show and people don't know what we really do."  Maurice spoke as much for himself.     "A woman hit me last week because her husband was lost over Frankfurt and I wasn't even in uniform."  said Simms who was obviously still upset by the incident.     The sense of kinship grew stronger in Maurice. "I must lunch before I return to London. Join me, won't you?"     Simms shook his head.     "Please, you could tell me more about your, er, work."     Later Maurice could not say why he asked Eric to accompany him, neither could Eric say why he accepted.  Yet both men were glad they had sat together in the corner of the small tearoom at the top of Downing Street.      No one paid any notice to their quiet talk nor even Eric's drawing on the napkin with a fork. After lunch they walked back to the lab together - Maurice to repair his failure to sign out when they had left for lunch, Eric to continue his work.  Both men knew a little more about the other and both liked what they knew and what they thought they may come to know.  Eric now had Maurice's address in his notebook, ”should anything important come up” - putting it this way had eased any possible embarrassment on either side.                                                                          #						#      'Today I have met someone with whom I could communicate.' Maurice wrote in his journal that night.  'He comes from Brighton.  He has a sister ten years older than him who lives with his mother.  His father died when he was three.  He often feels his work is not fully appreciated; he has only a small basement room to work in while those with less need have a full laboratory on the first floor.  He has suffered from ignorance and misunderstanding!  Does everyone who is not a child or an elderly have to wear a uniform to be safe?  It is, of course, easier for me now, but it can still be unpleasant.'                                                                                     #					#    The next morning he wrote an amended report on Dr.Simms suggesting that the long wait for equipment had both unnecessarily stressed and delayed the scientist.  He handed the file over to Horace.  "He tells me he has asked for some extra equipment that's vital, but he waited over six months for the last lot."     "Is it a live file?"  Asked Horace.     "Yes, it’s had the go ahead since he began it in March this year."      "What's he after?"     "Mullard valves, he wrote to the Ministry for them."     "He'll be lucky, that's American material.  What's the project's priority?"     Maurice looked at the file's prefix.  "A2"     "Possible, but not probable, I'd say,"  replied Horace.  "I'll stamp it up anyway and pass it on to central; but, dollar purchases are under quota and the RAF gets most of them."     Maurice shrugged, "If they want the research done."  He went back to his desk.     What exactly Eric Simms was researching was still not clear to Maurice, despite the explanation he had been given over lunch. That it had to do with resonance and high frequency sound he had grasped, but not much more, for the last part had been in the form of equations that  “were so  obvious I don't know why no one's seen it before.”  They had not been obvious to Maurice but he had not said so.     Fran brought tea and interrupted his memory and musings; he had a big job to plan for and he had better get on with it.  Only one file, but the task could take some weeks.  He had to assist in the resiting of a training facility for demolition frogmen; one area under consideration was near Plymouth, the other in Rosyth.      Plymouth proved to be unsuitable, according to the naval captain from submarines who met Maurice from the train.  And, the sooner they went over the other site the better.  Maurice wondered why they'd bothered to send him down here in the first place.     "Do you know where the other site is?" he'd asked the man.     "No idea,"  had been the curt reply.     Maurice told him.     "God's teeth!  Rosyth?  Are you sure?"     Maurice showed him the relevant section of the file.     "We could go up tomorrow," he was thinking of the distance. "And be there next day, with luck."     Maurice agreed.       It appeared that the officer had a wife in St. Budeau.  It also transpired that he thought the other site was also in the Southwest and he had been hoping for a few days with his wife.     "Perhaps," Maurice suggested, "He might like to go over the local facilities again, just to be sure?"       Maurice watched with fascination while the man wrestled with the conflict of duty and desire.  He imagined the turmoil within, the want and need for the woman soft and yielding while duty, self-respect, honor and a fear of being found out hardened his resolve and self denial.  The man shook his head.     "Damn good of you to suggest it, old boy, but better not."     They would set off next morning with the first train.  That gave Maurice the afternoon and evening in seaman's town and the officer a night with his wife.     It could not then known to either one of them - and was only later to be known to Maurice - that this was the last night the captain would ever spend with his wife.  Two days later while the two men bumped over rutted roads toward the few huts on the loch side, a limping Dornier dropped its load of dock-bound bombs early and turned quickly for home.  While its bretheren fell harmlessly into fields, the last of the string caught the edge of the St.Budeau married quarters.  Widowing him at the moment he stepped from the truck, accepted a light from the driver, and looked with approval at the deep dark waters they had come so far to see.      The captain was smiling. "Looks good, looks damn good to me."     Maurice said nothing, he was thinking of Eric Simms, a hot meal, a bath, and wondering how much colder he could get before hypothermia set in.      The first three days were almost unbearable as far as Maurice was concerned.  He was always cold, the wind was unceasing, and slush flurries made everything wet.  The captain with the four sailors, who had arrived the next day, were busy making their measurements and compiling their lists. These they then handed to Maurice to transmit by the one village operator-connected telephone to the various supply bases.  It was his job to instruct from the list provided in the file.  It appeared no one was to be able to put the whole story together, hence he telephoned over half the country demanding, threatening, and cadjoling.  The sooner the material arrived the sooner he could return to civilization.   He sat freezing by the black iron stove in the end hut on the third day wondering how he could, without offending anyone - or if that were not possible then offend them he would - avoid another night in the same room as the other men.  He had never shared a room with anyone apart from Ernst and that had been very different.  The drapped blanket between the sailors, himself, and the captain did nothing to assuage his distinct uncomfortableness.  He could not exercise, he could not sleep for the snoring and the smoke, and he neither shared nor enjoyed their jokes.  The captain seemed oblivious to the discomfort.  There was hot corned beef stew, plenty of tobacco, and an unending supply of nightcap drink.     "Better than a bloody sub."  Was his constant refrain.     The phone rang.     "Its Agnes," Maurice was used to her brogue, "At the post office.  It’s your London call."       In desperation Maurice had called Fran earlier and she had Horace call him back.       "Can you get hold of a truck?"  Maurice said he could.  "Then go into the village and see if you can get a billet there.  Tell them your birdwatching or something.  There's no sense in suffering, old son."  And he'd rung off.     It was that simple.  He took the truck to the post office, for if anyone knew of a place, it would be Agnes.  It was a postmistress' job to know these things.     "Och aye, I ken the Minister's a room in his hame."     In fact it turned out that he had two spare rooms and a housekeeper.  That night after an excellent meal of pheasant  and enough apple pie to nearly burst him, Maurice crawled  into a huge feather bed with a roaring fire in the bedroom grate and slept better than he had for many a month.  Breakfast was similarly filling, the minister obviously believed in corporal as well as spiritual sustenance.     "And will you be out by the loch today?"     Maurice said he would, birdwatching.     "That would be with the officer and the four sailors, would it not?"     Maurice confirmed it would be, both he and his interlocutor accepting the fable for what it was; there would be no more questions and therefore no more evasions.     His nightly absence was not commented upon, nor he assumed was he missed.  The captain prefered to stay with the men although he appeared grateful to Maurice for the offer of the other room.   Lorries began to arrive at the site and buildings blossomed as did the small naval population.  By day he was busy, the evenings were his own by choice.     "There's little enough to do here of a night."  Said the Minister one evening, "Unless you've a bookish mind.  My father had a fine library and I have added to it, some may be to your taste.  Do browse as you wish."     The library too had a fire, the flames flickered off the dark polished panelling, made the backs of the leather bound books glow, and filled the room with a sweet smoke and a sense of eternity.  There Maurice found an original volume of Hine poetry in German, read Baudelaire in French, became enchanted with Donne and experienced his first epiphany.  Apart from a Saturday evening when the Minister would join him to write his sermon for the next day, the library was solely his in the week.  Pastoral visits and visitors  kept the kindly man busy, and even when they did not, he understood Maurice's need to experience this  world alone and so gave him soverign dominion of the books.       Now all too soon his work was done and with four days left to Christmas he said his goodbyes to the men, the lately silent, grim-faced captain and the Minister and his housekeeper.  He waved to Agnes at the post office as the driver took him and the parcel with the Hine - inscribed, 'To Maurice, the only man I ever knew who could read it.  With best wishes, Hamish Goodchild.' - to the Station and the eventual London train and home.     The cloying smell and the threadbare familiarity of home struck Maurice more forcibly than ever before.  His mind and stomach heaved with the all pervading poverty of spirit and aspiration. That his grandparents asked no questions of him was more than made up for by the constant quizzing of his mother. Afraid lest she should lose him as she had lost his father to the secret ways of war that speak only of victory and glory, she sought to pierce the veil and to so fix death by her knowing.  Maurice sought to comfort her with some little truth and much assurance of his great distance from any  front either home or abroad.  Her fear assuaged for now, she clung to him as she had when he was a child and drowned him in her overflowing love.  Later in his room, he cried for her loneliness and for his folded sepia  phantom father in the small black wood frame.     It was his grandfather, who for the first time since 1933, felt fully employed again with his tin hat bicycle and whistle, who remembered the letter for Maurice put behind the clock with the bills.     "It came a week or two ago when you were away.  Its postmarked Cambridge."       Maurice bore it urgently to his room.       'Dear Maurice Vigor,            I don't know if you have any plans for Christmas or even if you will have any free time - it is so difficult these days to arrange anything given all our uncertain futures.  However, should you find yourself at a loose end, I am at home from the 23rd to the 27th (damned lab is closed).  You would be most welcome to stay for all or any of that time.  Mother would like to meet you, as would Sis.  Do write, or telephone on Brighton 3464.                             Best regards, Eric Simms.PS  The Ministry wrote and are 'sympathetically considering' my request.  Thanks again, old chap, for everything. E.S.     Maurice's first thought was of joyous escape for the holiday, a Christmas away from the unvarying dullness of his grandparents’ celebration which had taxed his tolerance even as a child.      His mother would be upset at his absence. Yet she would, of course, accept it, wet eyed and yielding as she had been all her life.  Maurice wondered if it was this very aspect of her nature that attracted loss and disappointment to her like a magnet.  He would just tell her that he had to work so she need only feel loss, not loss and rejection for he knew it was the latter that would hurt the most.       He decided that he would ring tonight and go down tomorrow; if it worked out he would stay, if not he could erect a pretext and leave.  As he confirmed his decision to himself two thoughts struck him.  Frstly that Eric obviously thought that he had had something to do with the Ministrys 'optomistic' response.  It was in no way due to him - the file could not have connected with the letter from Eric in this short time.  Anyway, he knew that 'sympathetic consideration' usually preceeded the 'however we are regretfully unable' letter.       Secondly, the lab would not be closed, he had noticed in the porter's cubicle while signing out, a rota of Christmas duties including the 25th and 26th.    So why had Eric said it was closed?  Was it closed to Eric, if so why?  Or had Eric just said that.  Did he want to be home for Christmas and thought if he invited Maurice it would make it less precious if he said the Lab was shut?  But they hardly knew each other, not that Maurice was averse to getting to know Eric Simms - there had been an instant familiarity.  The thoughts chased each other about in his head getting nowhere.      "Well, whatever. I'm going to go anyway."  Maurice said to himself as he sorted out his change for the corner telephone.     The connection was a bad one and he had to shout his name.     "You must be his friend who's coming for Christmas.  You are coming aren't you?"  The voice was high-pitched and plummy.     Maurice said he hoped to, he didn't know what train he would be on, though.     "Telephone from the station when you arrive is best," said the voice. "We're all looking forward to meeting you. Eric's told us so much about you.  He's resting at the moment and I don't want to disturb him, you do understand."     Maurice said he did and would ring from the station.       Walking back from the corner he realized that he had as yet bought no presents for his mother his grandparents or, as he now must, for his Christmas hosts.  The family presents were as ritualistic as the day itself: a china ornament for his grandmother's collection, a sporting calendar for his grandfather, and perfume, the fragrance now at least chosen by himself, for his mother.  Each unwrapped would be greeted by the words, 'its just what I wanted' and he would be kissed, though the pat on the head and 'what a clever boy' had ceased some years ago.       Gifts for Brighton would require more thought and a wider choice than the High Street could provide.  He would stop off in the West End and walk along Oxford Street and then down Charing Cross Road.       The next morning, the 23rd Maurice joined the late shoppers hurrying from shop to store in their search for suitable gifts.  What to get for Eric's sister and mother was still a problem. He had never met them and was not sure what etiquite demanded of a festive house guest.  After much thought and an hour’s fruitless window shopping, a display in Bourne and Hollingsworth caught his eye - a hamper of off-ration delicacies that was also a picnic basket. Expensive but ideal and when wrapped he could carry it as a case by the stout leather handle.  Making his way  toward Tottenham Court Road with his purchase Maurice realized that this was the most he had ever spent on a single item and it gave him a sense of satisfaction that was as unique to him as was the gift.     Turning left he forced a route through the crowds, who all seemed to be going in the opposite direction and made his way toward Foyles.  He had never been to Foyles before, and until Hamish Goodchild had extoled its literary virtue he had not even heard of it; but now he was inside.  Here he knew he would find a book for Eric, one that he hoped Eric would enjoy.         Knowing poetry to be peculiarly personal and not knowing Eric well enough to be certain of his taste, and feeling the same would probably apply to general literature, Maurice was for the moment stumped.  Yes, get him a book, but what book?       "May I be of assistance, sir?"  The elderly floorwalker was discretely at his elbow having singled Maurice out as a serious buyer from his years as a salesman and by recognising the hamper which was not an item purchased by the impecunious.     "I, er, yes,"  Maurice was caught unawares, however his hesitancy only further confirmed the salesman's opinion.  "I require a book for a friend, but have discounted literature.  He's a scientist."  That wasn't quite what Maurice meant, but it served the purpose.     "Ah, may I suggest art, perhaps?"  These were the most expensive books, apart from some musical scores.     "Maurice nodded, "Yes, art, what a good idea."  Despite all his intentions, Maurice could still occassionally be intimidated by the servers of the privileged and rich.     The salesman was both observant and when it came to ‘friends,’ was not disimilarly inclined to Maurice.  "May I suggest something neoclassical, sir, perhaps Michaelangelo?"      The binding was silk.  The illustrations in half tone were subtle and caught the sculpture's nuances to perfection.  It was, without doubt, a collector's book.  Maurice was enchanted, he had never before seen the human figure, the male figure, so exquisitly portrayed.  He knew instinctively that Eric would admire it as he did.     "I think that would be most suitable."  He looked directly at the salesman, "Most suitable."     "Indeed, sir."  The man bore it away, returned with it wrapped and the little change from the note Maurice had proffered.      Twenty years ago the salesman might have risked a suggestion, a meeting later to discuss art, perhaps; but now he could only vicariously imagine, and give Maurice a leather bookmark, “gratis”, as he said with a smile and a slight squeeze of his hand.      The case, the basket, and the book took all Maurice's energies to keep together on the train to Brighton.  The rack was crowded, the carriages standing, the isles impassible and the journey interminable.  Finally with a clanking, steaming shudder the engine nosed into the buffers and stood panting while the carriages disgorged their weary, but cheerful cargo.  It appeared to Maurice that half of the town had come to the station to meet the train while the other half had been on it.  At last he found a telephone, waited his turn in the short, orderly queue and called Eric's home.       "Hallo."  Maurice recognised her voice immediately.  "I'll tell him you're at the station and he'll be there in minutes.  Did you want to speak to him?"  The question was an after thought."     "No need, I'll wait by the buffet."  He had noticed taxis turning there.      The mid-afternoon sun was warm and he could smell the sea blown up from the front by a light and playful wind whose ancestor had once carried the rumble of Flander's guns to tremor the windows of the town.  He looked up - a thin line of cloud was edging in from the southwest hinting at rain, but making no promises.  A gull wheeled in screaming from some fruitless sortie of its own to land heavily on the roof to his left. The hard-hooked beak opened and closed and the cold yellow eye, knowing him as neither threat nor food ignored him and for a moment Maurice was diminished.  What was this war, this struggle of men to him who already had dominion of land, sea, and air?       The green Wolsey pulled up beside him and Eric lent over to open the door.  "Can you get your stuff in the back?"     Maurice pulled the seat forward and placed the case and two parcels carefully on the back seat.  He climbed in the front, pulled the door shut, and smiled at Eric.  "Thanks," he said, "for the invite and for the lift."     "Damned glad you could make it."  Eric was grinning at him as he let the clutch in.  "Mother bagged some petrol from the doctor, he's quite keen on her really and eats out of her hand."  He pulled out of the forecourt and started up the hill.  "It’s not far, but I wanted you to arrive decently, first impressions and all that."       Maurice had not expected Eric to be so concerned about impressing him; if anything, it ought to be the other way around, unless, of course, arriving decently meant not on foot like some tradesman caller.  That would not have impressed the Simms family if the voice on the phone was anything to go by. Eric, it turned out, was older by nearly four years, had had the best of educations, and was not short of money.  However the fact that he was concerned for Maurice, for whatever reason, made it easier for him to relax and to leave Leytonstone behind him as he entered the social world of that English middle class who made their choices by whim, not affordability.     The first impression was of a large, red brick house with Tudor chimneys set in lawns with a tree-lined gravel drive sweeping from the road to the front door.  As Eric pulled up throwing a small shower of stones ahead of him, the door opened and his mother and sister came out onto the front step.     "Leave those, we'll get them later,"  he said as Maurice went to pick up his case, "I want you to meet Mother and Sis."     Sis was quite tall, pale, a lot like Eric to look at with the same thick, dark hair cut short and the same deep brown eyes where pupil and iris merged to be indistinguishable from one another.     "I'm Jane.  Welcome to 'Posthill',"  Her's was the high plummy voice, "I've been dying to meet you, Eric never brings friends home."       Maurice smiled at her, then turned to the grey-haired elegant woman who was watching him and her son with bright appraising hazel eyes.  "I'm pleased to meet you, Mrs. Simms."  He said and was rewarded with a soft smile and a softer hand.     "Do come in.  I would think you could manage a sherry after your journey.  I'm sure it’s not too early."  The smile now had a mischievious edge to it and Maurice could appreciate her particular attractiveness.     The room was large and warm with a log fire that immediately reminded Maurice of Hamish Goodchild's library. There were some tasteful decorations and a small tree in a far corner.  Everything that was there belonged there, was right and blended with everything else.  He was sat down by the fire in a large leather arm chair, his coat and hat were bourne away, and a glass of sherry brought to him on a silver tray.  Jane sat opposite him and began to grill him with questions about where he and Eric had met, what he did and where he came from.      From the corner of his eye he could see Mrs. Simms sipping her sherry and smiling, she would not intervene in the interrogation as long as he held his own.  He heard Eric bringing in his case and the parcels and take them upstairs.           "I've put you in the back guest room next to Eric."  she came and sat next to her daughter on the settee.  "I think that'll be alright, don't you?"  Her head was slightly tilted in question and answer.     "Thank you," said Maurice. "I'm sure it will be."     Eric came bounding in, poured himself a drink and threw himself onto the settee bouncing the two women with his abandoned arrival.  It struck Maurice that Eric was capable of wide swings of mood.  In Cambridge he had been very down and now he was quite frenetically active and bursting with a cheerfulness, although Maurice sensed it as fragily grounded.      The rest of the afternoon of the second Christmas eve of the war passed quickly, but with a growing sense of ease and comfortableness. Jane was not as 'proper' as he had first thought she might be.  Eric grew less frenetic and became more and more charming and fun as he relaxed and reaffirmed with Maurice their liking for each other.  Mrs. Simms was obviously happy to have Maurice there and was gently attentive to his needs and comforts.       It was ten thirty when they finished the last rubber of Bridge with Jane and Maurice slightly ahead of Eric and his mother.  None of them played particularly well, but it was obvious that they had all enjoyed themselves.  Jane was going to midnight mass at the parish church with a girl from next door; they both had 'special friends' in the navy.     "Nothing serious, but, you know how it is,"  said Eric, "especially at Christmas."     Maurice had said he did.     Both Jane and Mrs. Simms found him charming and privately declared him to be a most excellent friend for Eric.     The guest room was comfortable and shared a bathroom with the larger room that was Eric's.  He stood at the bathroom entrance while Maurice unpacked his suitcase.     "It used to be the nursery, Jane's and mine,"  he waved his hand at the room "Then I had it as a study for a while.  Do you like the decoration?"     Maurice nodded, the room was in green William Morris paper with complimentary fabric on the chair and bedcover.  "I think its very tasteful."  He said putting the last of his shirts in the drawer.     "Good, because I chose it."  Eric was pleased.  "Come and have a nightcap."  He didn't wait for an answer but made his way through the bathroom to his own room leaving the doors open for Maurice to follow.     Eric's room was panelled like the downstairs drawing room, had a fireplace, but no fire and was far more somber in its brown tint paper and fabric.  One wall was books and a large desk was in front of the curtained window.  He poured a brandy from a decanter on his bedside table.     "It is Christmas," he said by way of excuse as he passed the globe to Maurice.  "To us, to Christmas, and to victory."     "And to your successful research."  added Maurice.       "With your help it will be."  replied Eric finishing his drink, but a dark shadow crossed his face and for a moment Maurice thought him in pain.     For a while Maurice lay awake thinking.  He had brought enough clothes for the four days, though living in hotels and digs for the last few weeks had made him adept at 'managing', as Joan had once put it.  He had brought money with him, too, just in case, though he hoped not to have to spend too much of it.  It was so important to maintain the necessary appearances if one wanted to rise socially and Maurice wanted to rise.  To be accepted and to escape his past.  He had the brains - he knew that.  Now he was picking up the skills and the friends.  It was strange, perhaps, to be grateful to a war; but Maurice was grateful, for all that he was becoming was due  to the opportunities war had presented him.  He fell asleep swearing not to miss or waste them.           Christmas day dawned bright, but colder.  The families' after breakfast pre-present opening walk took them a little way along the cliffs and then back through the woods.  It had been strange to look out to sea and to know that only those few miles away lay a desperate enemy still intent on invasion.     "Colonel Dainton-Brown is certain it will be in the spring."  Mrs. Simms had said with a shudder.       "They'll never have air superiority now," Jane was adamant "And there's the navy."     Neither Maurice, nor Eric said anything; both kept whatever thoughts they had on the subject to themselves.     The walk over, it was present time and an aperitif before lunch.  Jane and her mother had been up early and all was well prepared.  Maurice was surprised how much more appeared to be available to the better-off in the country.  Perhaps they, too, had blackmarket access, but to one that dealt in more than tinned meat and fruit.      His house gift of the hamper was greeted with genuine surprise and pleasure.  The little pot of caviar brought squeels of sheer delight from Jane who expressed him 'a splendid fellow'.  Maurice had never tasted caviar but was happy to defer that experience preferring to increase the ladies’ portions and his standing in their eyes.         Eric was speechless with his gift, and after briefly showing it to his mother, he bore it away to his room later demanding that Maurice write the date and sign it.     His present from Eric was a light tan cashmire cardigan which he wore for the rest of his stay at Posthill.  The time passed all  too quickly for the both of them and then it was back to London and to Cambridge.  Maurice had to promise both Mrs. Simms and Jane that he would return soon.  It was a promise he was happy to give.      "I've only got my rooms and that would be a bit difficult,"  said Eric.  "But I really would like you to come down when you could.  There's the Blue Boar but  it,s a bit steep."     It was never suggested by either of them that Eric should come to see him in London.     "Look, write and I'll come up with something,"  said Eric finally, "That's assuming you don't get sent to somewhere really remote for months on end."     "Or you get so involved in your work you forget what year it is!"  Countered Maurice.       "1941,"  shouted Eric.     "Not for four more days" Maurice called back as the Cambridge train pulled out of Liverpool Street and he turned to take the underground to Leytonstone.January to December 1941.     For Maurice the first few days of the new year were depressing and anticlimactic.  His home was more drab and more limited than he had ever felt it to be before, his job banal, his authority spurious.  He felt empty and fraudulent.        By the second week in January he was feeling more like his old self again. Eric had written and appeared from the letter to be in good spirit.  A new line of experimentation was giving encouraging results; he had heard from the Ministry and would be receiving the necessary valves.  And, he hoped to 'have a surprise' for Maurice in the near future.     Obviously the break at Christmas had made a great difference to his state of mind and to his health.  During his stay at 'Posthill', Jane had confided to Maurice that Eric had always been delicate.     "Not so much physically," she had said, obviously finding what she had wanted to say difficult.  "He's very clever, you know."     "He gets terribly involved in his work?"  Maurice had ventured trying to make it easy for her.     "He has such dark moods," she looked away for a moment.  "For two years he wouldn't go to school and mummy had a tutor for him.  It's just, well, he doesn't make friends easily and people do misunderstand him," she finished lamely.     Maurice had said nothing for a while and a silence lay numbingly between them.     "I think he just needs someone to care,"  he said at last thinking also of himself.  "Apart from family," he added quickly.     Jane put her hand on his arm.     "I know you'll be good for him," she said. "Just be prepared for him to be unreasonable some times."  Then she stood up abruptly as if afraid she had said too much or transgressed some secret boundary and they had continued walking in the garden and talking about the war as if nothing personal had been mentioned.      Perhaps, thought Maurice, someone like Dr. Howlett had made some suggestion at just the right time for Eric to accept it.  Maurice hoped this current optimism in his friend would continue.  For himself, it had been no more than the pasage of time and work that had removed the dark cloud of dissatisfaction that had descended when Eric had left for Cambridge.     Apart from one day in Kent, Maurice had been office bound since Christmas.  There had been reports to write and some visits to other departments where files and reports swayed to and fro as if in civil mimicry of the war fronts abroad. George's replacement was a dark ferret-like man with the hint of a Welsh accent, who had been with the Ministry of Defence for many years.  This job was, in his own words, just a simple transfer and not a promotion.     "I like travelling see," was the way he put it.     He had to be about fifty, was not very tall, of medium build.  Like Horace he smoked incessantly, but had no cough, that at least was something.  And he went by the name of Bryan Williams.  Maurice later found out from Fran that he had requested a transfer to more 'active' work when he had heard that his only son had been killed in North Africa.  He obviously had contacts in the right places was Maurice's immediate thought.    Little had been seen of Ted in the last weeks of the old year and he was not about much now.  According to Fran, he was deeply involved with some project that had begun even before the war.  Maurice was curious.  Fran could find out little more from the diary than she had already and Horace never said anything specific.  All he could discover was the code designation of E28/39, and that it involved the Gloster Aircraft Company - partly out of boredom - there was little for him to do at this immediate time - and partly because he liked to know things.  Maurice determined to discover what he could of Ted's assignment.     His own work remained local to London for the next few months.  He commuted between home the office and Woolwich Arsenal with the odd trip to the testing range on Salisbury Plain.  How anyone could have wanted to build anything, let alone a henge in that place, he could not imagine, unless of course it had been considerably warmer three thousand years ago.   He really felt quite sorry for the men under canvas.     By the end of March he and Eric had managed to meet only once, although their correspondance was now weekly and had for Maurice replicated, more than replaced, that which he had had with Ernst.  They were very open in their letters and confided dreams, feelings, and longings, with a total candor, that was, at least for Maurice wereless easy in the flesh.   They had been walking along the banks of the Cam near Grantchester one cold, late February day when Eric had asked him outright if he had ever 'had a woman'.  The question had really thrown Maurice for a moment.     "Have you?"  Maurice immediately asked in return.     "No, never fancied one."  Had been his friend's candid reply.     "Oh,"  was all that Maurice had managed in return.     "I've taken a cottage at Maddingly, told them I need to get away from Kings now and again."  He paused. "You could come and stay whenever you can get away, there'd just be the two of us."     Maurice knew what Eric meant.  He was not averse to the suggestion, far from it. However, he had never had any ongoing physical relationship in his life.  In the past, he had preferred the brief urgent anonymity of the casual, if dangerous liaison. For Maurice, admiration, friendship and sex were so far discrete entities.     With Ernst, there had been admiration and friendship that war now held in abeyance and may eve, by one reason or another, terminate.  With 'here and there' men, there had been sex in doorways, dark alleys and toilets - always urgent, always fraught.      With Eric, there was the opening bud of friendship, but it had not as yet become as totally effortless in three dimensions as it was in the two of pen and paper.  Now a rich, exciting, and possibly fulfilling extra element was being offered to him by a man he both liked and, he had to admit, envied.  The envy gave a piquancy he could well savour for he knew that he was stronger than Eric and that Eric knew it, too.  Maurice knew himself well enough to know that for him the ultimate in pleasure was power over someone else - power to order, or power to please.  Men who liked men had lent themselves both knowingly and unknowingly to his need, for in the last analysis Maurice knew that he did not need them.       Maurice looked at him, smiling, "I think that would be most enjoyable."       "Good, then it's settled.  Next time you can get away, we'll go there."     The rest of the day passed easily as the decision had been taken and both of them were happy with it.  Eric would have liked it to be now; Maurice preferred to wait and to enjoy the waiting, especially as he sensed Eric's want. They had dined together before Maurice's train back to London and the meal had the extra piquancy of expectation what was to come next time.    For Maurice there was much he wanted to think about and to commit to his journal.  He sat in the corner seat on the return journey to London and made notes to himself.  He often wondered when he sensed in himself the pleasure of a superiority - be it strength, alert thinking, or just having an edge - how similar he was to Ernst. Ernst, the Nietchean man.     Maurice thought about the newsreels he had seen, the newsreels of so-called Nazi arrogance and brutality. But he could not help wondering if the defeated did not deserve what they were getting.  After all, why should the victor not get the spoils?  Did the French deserve any different treatment had they not surrendered?  Ernst would fight because he was in conflict and he wanted to win.  That was how any species survived, by conflict and by winning and did not always mean by brute force. There were many ways of winning and it was up to each man to discover his own way.       "Bishop's Stortford, Bishop's Stortford!"  The guards cry pulled him out of his thoughts as the carriage door opened to admit an Army Captain who threw himself down opposite Maurice.     The train hissed and creaked out of the station. Maurice went back into his thoughts making odd jottings in his notebook as various ideas came into his head.  He heard a match flare and the acrid miasma of tobacco filled the carriage.  He looked up. The man was staring at him, the packet of Rhodian thrown carelessly on the seat.  Maurice pointed at the ‘no smoking’ sign.     "Do you mind."  said Maurice politely.     "Yes, I do." The man lent forward, "If I want to smoke I'll smoke and no damned  civilian is going to tell me otherwise."       He was obviously a little drunk and a lot bellicose.  He was also bigger than Maurice.            "There are plenty of smoking carriages."  Maurice refused to be intimidated.     "But I don't happen to be in one, do I?"  The man intended trouble.     Maurice flipped open his case; the pistol lay snugly in the bottom.  He dropped his note pad in on top and shut the flap.  The man noticed the MOD insignia.     "Bloody desk walla."     Maurice stood up and moved to the carriage door.  The man put his feet on the seat opposite.  Maurice half stepped into the corridor, then turned to face him.     "You may wear the uniform of an officer," he spoke quietly, "but you are no gentleman."  He lent forward a little, looking straight at him, "And no one knows that better than yourself."  He pulled the door shut and walked down the corridor to another empty carriage and sat down.  He felt he had won a moral victory, but the incident rankled and he wished many an unpleasant end on the man.        He saw him again briefly at the Liverpool Street station walking into the bar, for a minute Maurice thought of following, waiting for an opportune moment to strike, but what was the point?  He really wasn't worth it.  Maurice made his way home.  He had a lot of things he wanted to put in his journal and he also had the feeling that tomorrow might well be a busy day.      It is surprising how accurate premonitions can be sometimes.  It was not only a busy day, but a busy couple of weeks.  Something was obviously 'on' by the comings and goings to the Laundry.  It was the first time, too, that he had heard of Spain featuring in their dealings. Thus, Franco's announcement on the 26th that he stood at Hitler's side came as no surprise to Maurice when he heard of it.  Things were getting worse in Greece, North Africa and the Balkans, the Axis were pushing on.  Maurice was almost daily at either Woolwich or back on the wind-swept observation point at Salisbury Plain.     There was also more paperwork to do.  By mid-March he was desk bound in the office and for a couple of days Ted and Bryan were in as well.       "Like an old boys reunion," coughed Horace as he surfaced briefly from behind a pile of files.  "I never knew there was so much of this," he waved at the files, "going on."     Neither did Maurice nor Horace wonder just how much of this research would actually bear worthwhile fruit.  Certainly the latest 'weapon' he'd been observing and was now writing up never would.  Despite numerous modifications, it firmly refused to either attach itself to the tank or to blow up when requested.     "Waste of time most of it."  He spoke under his breath, but Ted had heard him and leaned forward.     "Not what I'm on isn't."     Maurice tried to look disinterested. "Oh?"     "Plane with no propellers," He put his finger to the side of his nose, "Beat Jerry legless it will."  He winked and went back to his report.     Maurice was not a lot wiser, unless there was something new with gliders going on.  He remembered how Ernst had said that many of his friends were training on gliders to become pilots.  Perhaps that was it. Certainly from the losses of last autumn we needed the pilots.     "Mo, can you help me with this?"  Bryan Williams was wedged in the corner waving at him. "I've got a stop and a start on the same place."     Maurice went over wishing for the thousandth time that Horace had never begun the 'Mo' business.  "Show me." he said.     "Stop it," he said reading the file quickly, "The stop date's later, someone up there changed their minds. Obviously, that'll disappoint a few people. Just send letters; you needn't go as it hasn't begun."     Horace looked up.  "Is that the Kettering plant?"     Bryan confirmed it was, something to do with synthetic quinine.     "I've got a memo on that over here."  Horace went over dislodging a pile of files that scattered across the floor in front of Fran who had a tray of tea in her hands.     "I'll get them."  She put the tray down.  Maurice grinned, sometimes he wondered how we'd managed to survive this far.          Despite hopeful letters from Eric it was not until the middle of May that Maurice was able to get a few days away at the Maddingly cottage.  As he and Eric lay in the garden looking up at the warm sunshine, in the same sky over Lincolnshire a Flight Lieutenant Sayer was making a seventeen minute flight in a plane with no propellors at over three hundred miles per hour.       The war news had not been good. Greece had been lost, air raids had been worse, and what news there was from North Africa had not been encouraging. The landing of Hess in Scotland was still the subject of much speculation.  Did Hitler want Britain out of the war as a neutral or even as an ally?     "I think he just had an idea of his own,"  said Eric who was tracing circles on Maurice’s chest with a grass stalk.     "Well, I think that there's far more to it.  Hitler has some new plan, you see."  Maurice wasn't sure of this, but he knew something unusual was afoot.  There had been a lot of people in and out of the Laundry and that always presaged something.  He lay back dreaming, letting Eric run his hands over his stomach and feeling the tenseness grow tantillisingly within his body.  Funny how at moments like this he could still think of work.  The thought drifted. The Laundry showed no intent of finding new premises; perhaps, it was come to Fenton Street to stay.  Eric lent over him, his breath warm. The thought of work faltered and vanished. Maurice gently stroked Eric's head waiting for the slow caress and the warmth of his mouth that heralded a blissful languor to come.     They dined frugally and retired early.  Tomorrow they planned to picnic on the Cam.  It was strange to relax in such idyllic surroundings while men died in plastic canopies, or drowned in dark seas, or bled in thirsty sands.  Yet they had the time and the right.  Eric had shown Maurice his progress; he was ready now to make the first prototype.  In experiment and theory the sound generator worked; now, he would begin the model.     "By the summer I'll have it, you'll see."     "I believe in you,"  said Maurice as he kissed him.  "You're a genius."     All too soon their few days passed.  Eric returned to his lab and Maurice to Fenton Street.       The next few months saw the sinking of the Bismark, the loss of Crete, the failure of Operation Battleaxe, the invasion of Russia, and Japanese aggression in Indo-China.     But for Eric it was success after success in his experiments, and his letters to Maurice brimmed with self confidence and affection.  Maurice continued his ordered facilitations and terminations with a growing confidence in himself, but without a similar confidence in the military outcome of much that he saw.  He and Eric had the occassional precious moments together, but like most lovers in wartime they were too few by far.  Those they did have did bring to Maurice a growing pleasure in being obeyed, however small the obedience, it did not matter.  Neither did the inaccuracy of Eric's prediction as to the timing of the completion of his model.  By late November it was still incomplete.     For Eric and Maurice, their personal disaster struck in early December.  No cry of 'Tora Tora', no late declaration of war but, for Eric equal infamy was planned and it came in a buff file received by Maurice two days after Pearl Harbor.     'Simms,E. Dr. Kings Camb. Sound punch research. Close Project.  Relocate:  Teaching, Kings. END.'     Maurice stared at the instruction envelope on Eric's file.  He read it again - there was no mistake.  The research was finished, no further funding, no laboratory space, no reprieve, no explanation.       "Mo."  He looked up. "Did I give you the Colchester file?"     "Yes,"  said Maurice still far away in thought.     "Can you do the Cambridge one at the same time?"     "Yes."  He didn't look at Horace.     "What's the status?"     "Which one?"             "Cambridge."     "Routine progress." Lied Maurice almost without thought.    "Right."  Horace made a note in his register. "And Colchester?"     "Same."     "Thanks."  Horace went back to his papers.     Maurice sat looking at the file.  'Close Project.'  The words lept out at him.  He couldn't do it, he knew that; but what could he do?  What if he did nothing, he thought, nothing at all?  He could remove the envelope from the file and, and what?  He could keep the file.  Horace's register would record 'routine progress', that was all.  What about 'above'?  They would have a terminate tag on the master list.  What if he sent a 'terminate' note through?  Then the funds would stop.  His mind raced with the possible permutations.  There had to be a way, there had to be.       He just had to find it.           December 1941 to November 1944    The scudding cloud broke the moonlight, dissolved the trees into darkness then returned to resurrect them.  Maurice wondered what it must look like from above seeing towns and cities vanish only to briefly emerge again pale guilded, then to fade away.  Could one see night and day rimming the earth if you were high enough?  The thought gripped him.  His mind tired from a day of fruitless wrestling with an apparently insoluble problem willingly submitted to the draining hold of his unconsciousness.     "'Ave yer got yer thermos?"       The words jerked him back into the room.  He heard his grandfather's reply shouted back to his wife and the door slam.  It was ten o'clock and he was off on his fire watch.  Maurice listened carefully and imagined he could hear the fading squeak of the bicycle as it progressed dryly on its way down the road.       He pulled his window closed.  He was cold now, his hands white from gripping the sill as he had leaned out looking toward the forest and further still, Cambridge, hidden in the darkness and by the curve of the earth.  What was he going to tell Eric?  Unsolved and unvanquished, the question battered him down onto the bed where he now lay staring up at the flaking whey-faced plaster.  Did he have to tell Eric?  This would not be a welcome Christmas present - they were to be at Posthill again this year and he had very different plans for them.  Perhaps he could leave it until after their break?  What if he just left it altogether and just did nothing at all?  The funds came automatically from the Treasury until they were stopped; it was the file returning from him to 'those above' that triggered the stop payment memo.  But what about the 'stop tag' on the master list?  The questions went round and round and time slid by.     He ignored the siren - if his name was on the bomb he would catch it, if it wasn't he wouldn't.  He heard his mother and grandmother run out into the Anderson.  One of them, his mother he thought, came back for something.  Probably her cigarettes for she had taken up the habit - for her nerves, she said.  They never bothered now to call him down.  They knew he would not come and often they did not even know if he was in until the morning when he left.     He sat up.  Outside, sharp bright fingers probed among the pebble clouds groping for a contact, for a wing or fuselage to offer to their steel-barking sisters whose long muzzles swung skyward.  He heard the irregular throb of one of theirs coming closer and he felt his skin tighten.  His room flashed as the guns on the corner of the lane, in the open land between the trees, spat steel and cordite to five thousand feet above.  There was no warning whistle, no jarring crunch, no bells for passing souls; the plane droned on and the guns fell silent.  Probably the docks again tonight, or the yards and factories by the river.  He stood up - a good time for a private cup of tea while the house was his alone.     The thin yellow bulb lit the drab room with the faded green flowered wallpaper and freize of roses. The dark framed prints of famous paintings, the photographs on the mantlepeice and the tired sofa with the one matching lumpy chair were ugly and familiar.  He sat at the table in one of the four straight-backed chairs that the room also boasted.  This was the best room, the Sunday room, the laying out room in times of death and peace.  It was a room that smelt of stale life, of cooking and tobacco.   As he slowly drank his tea he knew what he would do.     He would tell Eric nothing and he would do nothing.  Well, nearly nothing.  Horace rarely looked at a returned file; merely initialed it, marked his list and put it either in the Registry pile or the Ministry pile.  If Maurice removed it from the pile and hid it, it was ‘lost.’  If no one 'above' noticed anything, then there was no problem; if they did the file could eventually be found.  That at least would give Eric longer to work, and he could always claim not to have had the file in the first place.  Not perfect, far from it, but possible and a lot better than nothing or stopping Eric's work.     He washed up his cup and saucer in the sink, put them in the cupboard and turned off the lights.  Back in his night-lit room he breathed the air of the winter, quietly rejoiced in his victory, undressed and was asleep in minutes.       His Colchester call was routine, the journey on to Cambridge uneventful and the once obstructive porter at the Cavendish now accepted him without question.  He appeared to keep a visitor's badge for Maurice permanently in his office since the time Eric had first spoken to him almost a year ago.     The tiny laboratory, now so familiar, was even more cramped than before as Eric's clumsy looking amplifier cage took shape in the middle of the floor.       "But if this is only the model, how big will the full size thing be?"  querried Maurice stepping carefully over cables and wire mazes.     "Not much larger than this, once it all works I can pack it in quite tight you know."  Eric was soldering tiny connectors to each of the valves.     "I thought you said heat was a problem."  Maurice was desperate to really understand the workings of the machine.     "Oh, I shall use a fan or something."   Eric was now too involved in each piece to see the whole anymore.  It worked in theory, now it had to work in practice.  The problem was with the materials; the theory demanded working tolerances far in excess of what was currently possible.  With each component failure the joy Eric had experienced earlier in the year evaporated and his mood worsened.  However, Maurice could usually lift him out of the blackest moods, even when despair suceedingly drove him to spite and petty cruelties in their relationship.     Afterwards he would be filled with remorse and beg for forgiveness, willing to submit to any penance to repair the hurt he had given.  This pattern of failure, mood and then remorse, was to become more and more common in the coming year.  But for now hope, still triumphed.     Returning to London, Maurice was pleased how easy it had been to say nothing about the cancellation of Eric's research.  It was as if he could erase it from his mind like never had existed. As a child, if he had committed some small transgression, or broken an ornament or the like, he could deny it so convincingly to himself that no amount of questioning by an adult could force even the slightest indication of guilt from him.        He was as pleased and surprised how easy it was, too, to lose the file.       "All done."  He passed them both to Horace.     "Any problems?"  The usual question.     "No."  The usual answer.     Horace initialed them both on the covers and tossed them into the Ministry tray.   By late afternoon they were buried under other similar files, letters, papers and the usual 'bumph', as Fran called it.  While Horace was out for a moment and Fran was making tea for them and the Laundry, who had now come within her orbit in this matter, he slipped the file out and into his case.   Maurice then denied to himself what he had done until he had not done it.   Then, he forgot all about it.     Christmas came and went.  His plans for Posthill did not come to fruition, not by any fault of his, but by the mischance of the mail.  On Christmas Eve, Jane received a note that her 'friend', who in fact was far more than that - an engagement announcement was planned for his next leave - was missing in action.  His ship had gone down in the North sea while on convoy duty and he was not accounted for.  The dark shadow lay over the house, food was eaten, presents given, and drinks drunk; but,all the joy was absent.  Jane bore up well.  She practised hope and the others encouragement; but, the boltered ghost they all imagined stayed firmly at their feast.     Eric's first test in the New Year was successful.  The tiny die-pressed car he placed at the center of the cone shattered instantly and soundlessly as the current hummed the valves to life.  The next weekend that Maurice was down to the cottage, they went to the lab. and Eric repeated the experiment for him.       "It’s like it was just crushed by a silent and invisible hammer," Maurice said looking at Eric with a mixture of disbelief and pride.      	The humming stopped and the lights died in each of the great valves that circled the wire netted cone.	"Can I touch it?"  he asked, still in awe.	"Of course."  Eric was beside himself with pleasure at his friend's reaction.	Maurice reached gingerly into the cone and pinched some of the powder in his thumb and forefinger.  "It’s dust, just fine dust."  His voice was hushed as is the unfamiliar visitor to a place of miracles.	"Almost molecular metal, the bonding has broken down with the sound pulses," said Eric.  It left a fine blackness on his skin as he blew it off.	"Look."  Eric called him over to the microscope.  "This is a metal section before bombardment, and this is one afterwards."	Maurice screwed his eyes to the instrument.  One eye piece showed a regular pattern of lines with little dark shapes all lying in the same direction, the other an amorphous inchoate mass of metal dust.     "Can it do that to anything?"  He asked.     "Any metal."  replied Eric.     Maurice thought for a moment.   If he had followed his instructions, this thing would never have happened.  He had been right to do what he had done, whatever happened now.  	"Of course,"  Eric went on, "I need much more power for larger pieces of metal, and for harder metal where the bonding is stronger and the molecules more dense.  But in theory, any metal."     "So it could reduce a tank to dust."  Maurice was thinking of all the money spent on that thing that kept falling off on Salibury Plain.     "Yes, or a ship, or a plane."     "But…"  Maurice stopped.  He was looking at the cone, the little car had been in the middle of it.  Did Eric envisage great cages suspended ready to drop on the enemy.  He didn't want to say anything that was either silly or discouraging.     Eric immediately saw his question and laughed.  "No, I'm working on a way of directing the sound, a hose pipe if you like.  Then you just point and squirt.  Simple."   Suddenly he took Maurice's arm.  "No one else to know.  Say nothing.  This is just between you and me until it is perfect.  Some people will steal ideas.  Once anyone knows it works they'll try to copy my theory.  Do you understand? They'll want all the glory."  His grip had tightened and the haunted look came over his face, a look which Maurice had seen before.	"Of course, just us, isn't it always just us."	Eric relaxed and the moment passed.	"Celebration?"  asked Maurice.	"The Blue Boar."  replied Eric, my treat.		Winter became spring and spring began to move into summer when joy returned to Jane.  Her man was safe - picked up by a passing freighter after seventeen days of agony with a broken arm and burns. But he had beaten the sea.  The longboat had held ten men.  Others had not been so lucky when it fell from the angled davits into the grey, oilslicked swell and drifted northward.  Cold, thirsty, and very hungry, they had been taken on board a Norwegian vessel, landed at Oslo, treated and interned.  Now, less well-treated, but much healthier, they were in a German prisoner of war camp near the naval town of Willemshaven and the Red Cross had been notified.  Jane carried the single sheet of paper that had brought her the official news of his status until it crumbled, became almost illegible, and was put to rest in her diary.     Unfortunately, her joy was not mirrored by her brother, not that he was not happy for her. He was - it was just that as the events of the world turned to favour her they appeared to   turn against him.     At first he kept the news from Maurice, pretending small success in his letters and wanting news from the London world when they met.  His pretense worked. Maurice suspected nothing.  He would talk on about his visits, tell of a narrow escape when an air raid coincided with a three-day stay at Exeter, and read extracts from the papers.  Fascinated by the experiences of Malta, honoured with the George Cross in April, he began to read long passages from Harlin's History of the Island to Eric while the latter lounged in bed or bath.  Eric took to spending less and less time in the lab, preferring to be at the cottage where he could pretend even to himself.       In early May, Maurice was office bound for some days while he covered for Horace who had fallen ill with a chest infection.  While he fretted at the enforced desk bound inactivity, he made discrete checks, being careful not to disturb any sleeping dogs as to the central record on Eric's work.  As far as he was able to ascertain all was normal, no one had noticed the file was missing, the funds were flowing and no review was currently scheduled nor, said the clerk, likely to be.     "It’s all tickerty boo."  she'd said of the five file checks he'd sent up to her, one of which had been Eric's.  He felt relieved.  Perhaps it really was just that simple.	The Laundry was busy.  Something was definitely on.  Maurice recognised two of the recent visitors as Czechs from their language, not their uniform which Fran swore was Greek.  At last, Horace returned looking just the same, but smoking a little less - at least he let one go out before he lit the next.     "Doctor's orders Mo.  Got to cut down on the fags."     Maurice noted he now kept a bottle of vile-brown cough linctus in his desk next to his stock of emergency Woodbines.               Meanwhile, Eric had pulled himself out of that particular depression and had thrown himself back into the work with a vengeance.  But the god's were not with him and even small encouragements eluded him.  Components failed. Time after time, as he tried to increase the power output, valves would glow, surge brightly and for a moment the needle would peak and then they would blacken and pop softly inert.  Eric tried rerouting the current; he rewound his own high voltage transformers.  He slept in the lab growing thin and garrelous.     Maurice came down every moment he could, bringing food, flasks of tea, and endless encouragement.   Eric began to fear the war would be lost before his 'weapon' could save the Allies, had not the Japanese swept all before them and were now into the Philippines.   The Germans had Tobruk; in Russia Sebastopol had fallen, and the Russians were retreating in the face of new attacks on the Kursk-Kharkov front.       "Its all my fault, I just can't do it."  He clung to Maurice.  He lost faith in his idea and in himself.  So low had he fallen from those heady early January days that Maurice was afraid he may do something silly.  He begged Horace to find a way to give him time to spend with Eric.  Time was found; he was given leave for two weeks in mid-July.     Maurice decided to keep any war news from Eric.  He would rest him totally.  The weather appeared set fair and they could spend quiet days in the garden of the cottage.  Finding the necessary cooking and cleaning erksome and Eric too listless to help, Maurice took to reading while he worked.  When he was free to sit in the garden, he took his books with him and drew Eric into desultory conversation with questions and comments about art and literature.  Much of what Eric took as common knowledge was new to Maurice and like a thirsty sponge he absorbed all he could draw from his friend.     By the second week, Eric was much improved, at least physically.  Plenty of sleep and food - Maurice knew the back doors to many tasty morsels in both town and country - were having their healing effect.  His mental state, however, was less easy for Maurice to judge, but Eric did appear to be recovering his old faith in himself and in his project.  He began to talk of a new approach to the main problem of holding peak power.     "Of course, I'll have to rebuild the whole damn thing."  he said.  "I'm going to need more space, too.  And more equipment."     Maurice felt panic rise in him.  What if Eric's demands triggered some more detailed checks on his work and the original cancellation was discovered?  But he said nothing.     "Mind you, I might be able to manage if I can cannibalize some of the old stuff.  And there's a lot of high voltage equipment that's not being used upstairs, if I can get my hands on it."     Maurice relaxed a little.  "I'm sure we can get what you'll need."  He spoke reassuringly, for the benifit of both of them.     For the moment hope dispelled worry and the war.     "Let's play tennis!"  Eric ran outside.  "I found a net in the shed the other day."     It took them a couple of hours to rig up the long unused court, but at last it was ready.  Rackets and balls had also been located, although they had most certainly seen better days.     "Loser cooks dinner."  said Eric.     "Winner takes all."  Yelled Maurice serving into the net.     By mid afternoon the game had degenerated, helped by the heat and the bottle of wine they consumed. They put the Brownie on timer and posed for a picture, the camera balanced on a box.  Secure in the knowledge of the seclusion of their retreat they abandoned themselves to the sunshine to nakedness and to each other.       Neither heard, nor noticed, the woman who had left her basketed bicycle by the front door, had given up on knocking and had decided to collect some of the soft fruit her uncle had suggested she take from the garden.  She knew the two men who rented the cottage from her uncle were often here on weekends, but today was a Thursday.     She had filled half a bag when she heard their shrieks from the old tennis court. Curious, she approached the hedge.  Her natural tolerance and her classical education had not so much prepared her for what she saw, as made what she saw, not that terrible.  In fact, it struck her as quite 'Greek' as she was, years later, to explain to a very close friend.   She stood transfixed.  She watched them wrestle; she watched the rough and tumble of their foreplay soften into caress and then harden into urgency and release.  She watched the languor collapse them onto the grass and she crept away to cycle home with a half filled bag and a need of her own.		The same day that the first German forces reached the outskirts of Stalingrad, Eric found a partial solution to his problem of holding peak power.  He also discovered what he described to Maurice as a gaping hole in his theory.  But, far from plunging him into the pit of despair that Maurice feared, it seemed that Eric had thrown off this tendency so previously apparent, it spurred him to  a more determined effort.  A chance meeting on the stairs with Dr. Howlett led to further meetings with a team who were working on high voltage, low resistance conductors.  They came to a mutually beneficial agreement whereby Eric would have access to their materials, especially to the nitrogen cooling pots, while he would work with their test group who were weeks behind with their figures.  	It surprised Dr. Howlett how well this worked as Eric did not have a particularly good reputation as a team worker, considered by most of his colleagues as a prima donna.       By the time of the Anglo-American landings at Oran in November, Eric had written a paper which was to be submitted for publication in a prestigious journal on High Energy Physics.   	With the surrender of Von Paulus at Stalingrad came Eric's announcement to Maurice that he had totally rethought his project.  Now that he had the cooling facilities he needed he would start rebuilding immediately.  They celebrated with an evening at the theatre, a meal at the Gay Hussar, and despite some concern on Maurice's part, a room at a small hotel in Knightsbridge.  	In many ways, for the two men, the whole of 1943 was to be a year of surprising normality and routine despite the war and its demands.  Maurice continued his to-ing and fro-ing at the orders of the buff files, though far less than before.  Since the cuts in transport the previous September, every journey was now scrutinized for necessity before it was taken.  This restriction, however, did not prevent them from spending time at the cottage at every possible moment.  	In the lab, Eric built and tested, and was rewarded with small success after small success.  His new approach circumvented many of the previous problems and had so far  shown no major problems of its own.  The slowness of the work no longer worried him; he knew no one else was in this field - it was his and his alone.	"I shall be the first and I shall be remembered as the first." he boasted to Maurice one evening.  "And you will be the first to have witnessed it."  	Looking back much later, it was then that Maurice should have had the first inkling of the ego that would even exclude him from any share in Eric's achievement.  Often he had wanted to tell Eric what he had done all those months ago that had made all this still possible, but something always held him back.     Allied successes multiplied.  In May the Italians surrendered in Tunisia.  The Casablanca agreement on the invasion of Italy was now a reality and 'the soft underbelly of Europe' was soon to be kicked.  In June the Russians took Viborg.  By the time Victor Emmanuel had sacked and imprisoned (Mussolini and the Germans had rescued  and re-instated him,) the Russians were outside Warsaw and the Allies had Naples.     And so late autumn became winter, 1943 slipped into 1944, and winter began slowly to give way to spring.     Eric now had a working model half the size of the last one and at least ten times as powerful.  But as his success increased, so did his secrecy and his fear.  He refused to let Maurice into the lab. At first he used excuses, but as he ran out of these he just openly rejected any requests to see how the 'thing' was coming along.  In an odd way being excluded from the lab was rather like being excluded from Eric's life.  Yet in all other ways Eric was as loving and as dependent as ever.  It was only in his work he did not need, nor want, Maurice.  He appeared to have forgotten the pride and the joy with which he had demonstrated his first successful experiment.  It was as if he was being devoured by the increasing demands each new step required of him in terms of mind and energy.  He knew that the ultimate success was now tantalisingly close, and with it the accolade of his peers and a grateful country -  it was to be his and his alone.  He could not see that Maurice did not want to take any of this from him, but only as before, to help and to be there.      By the spring, Eric's increasing paranoia was affecting what little life they now shared outside of the lab.  Many times Maurice had come down to see him only to spend long hours alone.  Tiring of the cottage, he found solace in the libraries of the colleges and so he continued his love affair with old books that had begun in the home of Hamish Goodchild.  When exhaustion, hunger, or the need for a physical release drove Eric home he would snap, criticise, and exercise his cutting wit on Maurice.  Now there was little of the remorse or the contrite penance, which had made their affair of take and give so satisfying to both of them.	Back in London, on  evenings when hurt and want became too much to bear alone, Maurice haunted those quiet squares and lonely places where others whose tastes were not unlike his own might be found.  But there was no joy, and he felt he now had no sanctuary to return to from his journeys - there was only the office and his tiny attic room.  His empty world hung on him as prisoners’ clothes hung on thin and hungry men drawn living from the battle.	Poland felt the Russian boot again on its soil and the German fell back.   Free Poles and colonial French troops took strategic passes in the Atlas mountains of Italy and the American's looked unblinking toward the rising sun.  Soon it would be time to pick the one of three, to wind back the spring and then unleash the whirlwind.  Planes, ships, pipelines, harbours, vehicles and men crowded, joked, waited, swore, wrote home, jostled, leaked oil, made love, rusted, grated, and ground together.  	Eric pushed himself further.  In June 1944 he saw the final possibility of success; he hardly left the lab.  By mid July, he was ready but he could not pull the switch.  He looked at the maze of wires, at the terrible symmetry of the cooling pots, at the still silent transformers that crowded the room, and he wept at its beauty.  Here, visible in three touchable dimensions were the pages of formulations,  the four long years of struggle, the hope and the disappointment.  As he gazed into its very center he could see his idea enshrined in the cathedral of his calculations and he fell in frozen worship of it. He could not be alone and he alone could not give it life.      He sent for Maurice and Maurice came.     A different doorman now, younger.     "Excuse me, sir, what is your business?"     Maurice smiled and showed the worn and folded pass pulled quickly from the top pocket.  "Dr. Simms."  was all he said.  "Down stairs, sir."  And the man saluted.  Maurice knocked and called his name.  The bolts drew back, the door opened and he recoiled.  Unwashed, unshaved, unfed, unslept, the apparition caught his arm and pulled him in.     "I can't do it."  Eric croaked.  "All this time and now I can't do it."  He ran his hands over his creation, tender and reverent.  He had fathered it, but could not give it birth.       Maurice feared his friend was mad.  The red-rimmed  unfocused eyes pleaded with him.     "What do I do?"  Now he was afraid, afraid of Eric and of the 'thing'.     "The switch."     Maurice reached out, hesitated, took hold of his love and courage, and pulled the switch.     Instantly the room was alive and smelt of the sea and thunderstorms.  Their hair stood up, their skin crawled with fading blue electric worms, and a sound beyond their hearing accelerated into the metal sacrifice pounding it into dust.  Eric pushed a lever forward, then another, all turned to dust and he exhaulted.  The wires glowed and the pots smoked, licking flames materialised and Maurice pushed himself back against the wall.     "Stop it! stop it!"  His voice was lost.  He threw himself at the switch and pushed it up.  There was silence and a smell of burning filled the room. Someone was hammering at the door and Eric's screams came slowly.    	The hospital was understanding - exhaustion and shock, not uncommon.     "Damn good of you Ministry people, really."  Maurice wasn't sure what he meant by that.     "He will be alright?"       "Yes, given time.  That's all he needs, time."     Maurice left his number and taking the doctor aside explained the secrecy.  "Tell no one else, just me."     The doctor understood  This was not the first such case.     Maurice went back to the lab.  The fire was out, the room wet and smutted.  The 'thing' was twisted.  Its half burnt frame sagged against one wall; two of the pots had burst, the liquid transformed to gas and gone.     "It’s a bit of a mess?"  Dr. Howlett did not appear unduly concerned.  "Nearly burnt the place down.  You were both lucky."  Maurice nodded.  "Damn thing shook the floor above like an earthquake."      What could Maurice say.  He looked at the room.	"Oh, its all safe now.  We'll just close it up and leave it until he's back and he can sort it out.  Post mortem."  He shook his head, then noticed Maurice's face. He paused.  "You know, I occasionally wonder if we push the boundaries of science a bit too far sometimes.  One day we might regret it.  I must be off.  Bye."       And Maurice was alone with the corpse of a dream.  He poked about.  On the bench was a notebook, he picked it up.  He found a pad of diagrams and took those, too - they  went into his case.  He reached out to touch a wire; it crumbled and released a tension somewhere else; more crumbled leaving a hole in the cage.  He left the room pulling the door behind him.  It was all over.     Each weekend he came down to Addenbrooks and slowly he noticed a change in Eric.  His weight and strength had returned, but his mind was still numbed by the loss.  He spoke little staring out into a space only he could see.  His mother and sister made the journey and thanked Maurice for his care.       Arnhem came and went, and Eric returned.  Slowly at first, like a sleeper awakening, he drew himself together.  He could leave the hospital.  Maurice took his leave and they went to the cottage.  September slid into October and the mists were cold in the morning.  He kept a good fire of logs in the hearth and they took walks - less easy now to get lost since place names were returning to the signposts.  They ate well and early.  Eric slept long and alone while Maurice read.       "I've got to go back tomorrow."  The room was lit only by the flames.     "Yes,"  said Eric, "I know.  Would you stay if you could?"     "Of course, you know that."  The first tenderness was happily received.  "Would you like me to?"  Perhaps he could have a few more days.	"No," said Eric, "I wouldn't."  And he went to bed.	The letter from Eric came later in the week - he was beginning again. This time it would be easier; after all, it had worked.  What he needed was a new place to work in, much more equipment and an assistant.  He was telling Maurice this because he expected a full report of the success to be sent to the Ministry. He had already sent them a letter listing his current requests.  There was not a word of thanks for protecting and returning the notebooks and records of the experiments.     Pain and panic hit Maurice simultaneously.  He must get that letter.  He must see Eric, but how?  If the Ministry checked back and the work was shown as cancelled yet still went on....his mind raced.  The file was still hidden where he had put it.  The fact that Horace's initials were on it counted for nothing; it was he who had been there, he who had kept the 'satisfactory progress' memos going in to the paymaster and suppliers.      Why was Eric going behind his back?  Before he had always asked him to get what he wanted.  Did he blame him for the loss of the machine, because he had switched it on?  He had also switched it off.  But that made no sense; surely he could not be blamed by Eric for that.       He tried to phone but his calls were not accepted.  He tried ringing a contact at the Ministry, but no letter from a Dr. Simms had as yet been received as far as he knew.  He was trapped.  There was no where to go, nothing he could do.	Immobilised, Maurice waited; he could only wait.  Fran brought him tea and some biscuits and told Horace she thought Mo was sickening for something - he was so pale. Horace gave the next two jobs to Bryan. Ted, now that jets were common knowledge, was off on some new long term project down at Farnborough.  There was less and less now coming to the office.  The Laundry had moved out in mid June and upstairs was empty.  Fenton Street was winding down, the war was won in Europe.  All that was unsure was when the peace would come.	An other week passed and Maurice heard nothing.  Then, at first unrecognised as such, came salvation.     "Mo, have you seen this?"  Horace tossed a memo across to him and his blood chilled.  He read it, reread it and felt his stomach turn.  He looked at Horace.     "Who's a lucky bugger?  That'll teach you to speak French and German."  Horace grinned and lit a cigarette.  "Parlez-vous mademoiselle?  And just as it was getting nice and quiet here and we could put our feet up, too."     Fran came in.  "What's up?"  She dumped a small cake on the table.  "It’s a bit stale, got it from a Yank."	"Mo's got a transfer to France."	"What?"  Fran was disbelieving.	"You got cloth ears?  Our young friend is off abroad."  	There were twenty of them at the briefing drawn from various branches of the service, their job simple but urgent.  As the Germans retreated in front of Allied advances, they quit factories and research establishments, often in a great hurry.  Much was left behind: half destroyed equipment, papers, part used chemicals, waste.  All could tell a trained observer what had been going on there.  Teams of scientists were being put together, each team would have a civil servant who could speak both French and German and was experienced in dealing with 'boffins'.  This latter qualification  drew a laugh from the speaker's audience.  Their task: to collate, record and relate back to the Ministry.  The speaker paused, there were no questions?  Right, then each one of them would receive his list of sites to visit and his accompanying boffin and the necessary papers and that would be that.  The speaker looked over his glasses at them.  Of course if it didn't run as smoothly as hoped it was up to each of them to act independently and do what they could.     They all got the idea. 	Particularly Maurice who had an idea, one that was as simple as it was  obvious.     He had to go abroad.  He didn't want Eric to run riot back in England so take him, too.  But how?  Maurice went up to the canteen and sat with a cooling cup of tea while he thought. 	He looked at the name on the collating sheet, right.  He would see him first.  After all he thought, beard the lion and be hung for a sheep.     He found the door, knocked, and went in.     "Can I help you?"  She was about his age, red-headed to say the least and very freckled.     "I wonder if I may speak to G. Losey, please."  He pulled out his pass, more out of habit than need.	"Certainly."  She smiled at him.     Maurice stood there.  After a moment he said, "Well?"     "I was waiting for you to speak."  Her smile widened. "I'm G for Georgina, Losey."     Maurice laughed, he couldn't help it and it was obviously the right thing to do because she laughed with him.  The rest was easy.     From the records she compiled the lists.  If he happened to know a good free scientist then that was fine.  She'd get his papers, assign him to Maurice and make sure they dealt with anything suspected of being to do with wireless.	He could even drop the relevant file into her. She was grateful.  All he now had to do was to take out everything in Eric's file except the qualifications, clearance, and the fact he was teaching at Kings and drop it over to her.     The next task was to bait the hook for Eric.     He took the next train out of Liverpool Street and was in Cambridge by four thirty.     Eric was not at the Cavendish.  The taxi went on to Maddingly and he was not there.     "Kings, please."       The taxi pulled up at the lodge.     "Dr. Simms."     "C3, sir," the porter pointed the way.	Maurice knocked briefly, tried the handle and walked in.  Eric was at his desk, papers all over the floor and a student was in a chair opposite smoking a pipe that made him look very silly.	"You out."  Maurice said to the student who immediately fled.  "Eric, we have a problem."  He threw himself into the recently vacated chair as Eric stood and started to splutter. "The Germans are ahead of you."  Eric collapsed as if shot.     "What?"  He managed to gasp.     "The Germans have got a sound destructor.  I'm going over there and you're coming with me."  December 1944.     The lorry swerved to avoid something in the road and slewed sideways throwing Maurice up against the metal rail of the truck driving the breath from him in a gasp.  	"Mines!"  Yelled the driver as he fought with the wheel of the bucking five tonner.  The gears grated together as he flung it into reverse.  "I'll go back and use the other track."          Maurice waved at him with one hand while with the other clung to the bruising rail.  Eric was hanging on with both hands and mouthing something at him - he could make out the word 'bastard' but that was all.     "I'm sorry about that, Sir.  Should have been cleared by today."     It was nearly dark, drizzling and Boxing Day. They had been in France for two weeks.  This, howeve,r was the nearest they had come to the retreating enemy and as far as Maurice was concerned it was too near.  There had been sniper fire at Oise, frightening with its sharp crack, but aimed far away from them.  Mines, however, were something else.  The truck bounced across the field and turned sharply at the bottom of the hill; the engine whined in the low gear, but the going was now smoother.	"Been a few problems here with Jerry.  Seems they had a some sort of special works just north of the town and they didn't want to leave it.  Town itself's secure though, sir."  The driver was yelling to them over the engine.  "Well it was when I left it," he said quietly to himself.	Maurice relaxed a little, his breathing steadied.  Nothing had prepared him for this: the cold, the discomfort of dirty clothes, irregular food, lack of sleep and the ever present fear.	Lise had been the beginning of this particular nightmare.  The other nightmare was Eric. Not the old Eric, the man of vision and dreams, the man of genius who needed Maurice to help him bring them to fruition.  The man who had also eased but never eradicated his separation from contact with Ernst. No not that Eric. But the changed.   When he first called him that in his journal over three months ago it had been a private joke.  Now neither of them was laughing. They had not laughed together for a long time.  Maurice felt the sadness at the memory.  No, they had not laughed since they had played tennis 'au naturelle' and kept a  photo of it for their album.  	Maurice looked across at Eric who was staring at the floor of the truck.  His head twitched, not with the vehicles motion, but with some demented beat of his own.  Maurice could only measure the inner agony of failure that tore Eric's soul to shreds by the flaying words of blame he lashed at him.  Now the sympathy he had for his 'friend' was  tempered by the fear  he had for himself.  Eric needed a scapegoat and had cast him, once his accepted saviour, in that role.  Maurice knew that at any time Eric could again write to the Ministry, or make other telling accusations and this fear bred dark thoughts that overshadowed any understanding or tolerance he had left.      Maurice closed his eyes and tried to pull the events since the transfer together, to give them shape, order and discipline.  Only then he could dominate them and so escape subservience.  He forced his mind to slip back in time.	"A piece of cake gentlemen.  Just stay on our side of the line or you'll be shot as spies."  The military liaison and  briefing officer laughed.  "Seriously, the enemy will have fled, the Sappers will have checked  out any buildings for bobby traps, and all you chaps will have to do is your job."  He paused, timing his next comment for the laughter he expected.      "Your only worry will be in being overwhelmed by a grateful populace eager to reward the conquering heros."       The laughter was scattered, but they all agreed it had been a fine speech.  Then they'd piled into a cold and very noisy transport and flown to some field in the middle of nowhere.  They all carried identification as Allied Factory Inspectors, letters, and various passes.  They also had an issue of currency and individual lists of their 'target factories.'  Now Maurice knew what those tight lipped figures that had emerged from the Laundry must have been feeling.  He had not envied them then and he certainly didn't now.  He knew he was not the stuff of heroes.	Georgina Losey had been as good as her word.  Eric had been seconded to his team with all the required clearances and papers going via  Maurice.  Once Eric believed that someone else was working in what he considered to be his exclusive field, wild horses would not have kept him in England.  However, at the same time he was filled with suspicion and distrust.      He had at first demanded evidence believing this was just another ploy to block his work and to somehow force him to share his imminent triumph.  The tiny lab had been witness to his tirade of acrimony all the more hurtful for being without just cause or foundation.  Against fancied imputation and blatant innuendo, Maurice sought defence in silence which only reinforced the morbid and fallacious fantasies of a man who believed himself betrayed by the world.  Finally exhausted, Eric fell silent.	"Can you be so sure I'm lying that you can take that risk?"  Maurice had asked in that carnal house of affection.	Eric looked at him for a long time with dark unseeing eyes then shook his head. 	Maurice had won and Eric would come with him into that shattered and half liberated land to look for his chimera.    	Fearing that he may renege on this decision, which he believed was made more out of defeat than real conviction, Maurice stayed with him until the briefing and the flight negated any possible change of mind.      He need not have been so worried, for now Eric had convinced himself that somewhere, out there, 'his' machine was being hidden from him.  That somehow someone knew what he knew and was quietly building and winding and wiring; in his mind he could see it all.  He could hear it calling to him and in his fitful sleep he would call out waking Maurice with his cries.  The problem now would be more to restrain him to safe and non impetuous behaviour, than to encourage investigation.     Maurice had pointed out that it might take a while to locate the exact factory, but that he did have a list of possibles.  This at least Eric accepted.  So far so good. What Maurice  did not have was any idea of what he would do next. But at least Eric was with him here and not waking sleeping dogs in the Ministry.  	Lise, just north of Thionville on the ill-fated Maginot line, was their first reality of occupation.  For a start the 'target' factory was more a series of half underground Stygean storehouses than a real production unit.   There was no trace of radios or any research work conducted on the premisies.  Neither had any Sapper, nor even any soldier, been there before them.  The U.S. Third Army had at last broken the Germans at Metz. But seven forts still held out and the war was far from over in this area. Apart from a sporadic sniper later silenced by a Resistance man, the enemy had fled the town.  Though, the half-starved sunken-eyed chythionic ghosts that laboured there had not.  For both men it was a shock - this was a truth not reported, unimagined and unimaginable.       Neither man would have believed what they saw had they not seen it. At first Maurice felt that if all else were to be forgotten this should not be forgot. They stayed to help the locals where they could with what they could, but it was little enough.     But, far from welcoming the 'heros', most of the villagers were more concerned to settle old scores with each other.  Scores that had fermented all through the occupation.  Communist and collaborator struck at each other and neither welcomed the two Englishmen who had come with too little too late.  Soon Maurice began to wonder if this dismal place had not deserved the treatment it had received. 	Their money did not buy much; there was not much to buy.  They were hungry.  There was a room, expensive, without heat or water, with one bed and that they took in turns.  Eric did not help.  He carped and grumbled and held Maurice personally responsible for all their ills.  As things got worse he again began to threaten Maurice claiming he had hindered his work, refused him equipment and blocked his communication with senior Civil Servants.  He became unreasoning and unreasonable.  His old dark depressions began to alternate with fits of maudlin self pity.        The liberating Army had passed quickly and left little and was now involved in a desperate defence of the ground it had gained.  Though still many miles to the north, Manteuffel's 2nd Panzers  were pushing through the weakly held Ardennes and bulging west.  There was even the chance that they might swing south and retake the town - an event not totally unwelcomed by some of the inhabitants.  	As December waned, this appeared less and less likely as Patton's counter attack and the German's lack of fuel slowed the push to the west.  This, however, was little help to Maurice and Eric who were stuck in the town.  Their much vaunted papers appeared to carry no weight in the field and no one here was really interested in their welfare or problems.  In vain, Maurice made call after call to the liaison officers in the area.  Finally he reached a Captaine LeClerc who promised he would do all that he could to relocate them to their next objective.  That had been a week ago.             Yesterday, Christmas Day 1944, had been the most horrific day in Maurice's life.  Ignored by the surly populace of this unpleasant village, cold, with no rations and only a bottle of rough brandy between them, Eric had become drunk just after dawn.  He alternated between insult and taunt, demanding that Maurice love him, berated his attempts to do so, and mocked his pretensions to rise above his gutter class.  Finally, Eric had passed out in the mid-afternoon.  	What had once been friendship, respect, and love was now a pockmarked and festering slough.     Late that evening Maurice was called to the phone in the mayor's office. LeClerc had managed to contact a British unit who had transport and could accommodate them. They were to stand by.       The driver and the truck had come early in the next morning.  Maurice had help in putting Eric on board claiming he had been sick, was weak, but was recovering.  By noon, they were half way to their  destination when they pulled up under a copse of stark trees to 'brew a cuppa and a bite.'  The hot bully beef and the strong tea  sweet  with thick sticky milk was ambrosia and necter to the two civilians and did  much to restore both men physically. Though, Eric's hangover and dark mood still persisted.	The truck continued its climb.	"Will you want the hotel sir?"  The driver's shout broke Maurice's remembrances.     He looked up. "Hotel?"     "Right sir."  The driver had expected that all the officers were staying there and he changed up a gear as the gradient lessened.  Maurice had meant it as a question not an order, but it did not matter.  Steadying himself, he looked out of the canvas flap at the passing houses.  So this was Angoulime?  It was larger than he had expected and it looked quite prosperous.	The sight of the hotel confirmed his first impression.	"Room's on the second floor.  Hope you don't mind sharing, but we're a bit squashed at the present.  Bath's at the end of the corridor - look as if you could do with one, eh?"  The speaker was a jovial adjutant with thinning hair and a stomach that spoke more of food than fighting.  " Get settled in, dinner's at eight, , drinks in the lounge, and then you can tell me what I can do for you."  He'd looked at their papers and appeared impressed and approving.  "Knew bloody Jerry was up to something out there by the way he'd hung on.  Damn good show for you chaps to get out here so soon what?"  Then, almost as an after thought, he added, "Mind you, I doubt there's much left up there.  Most of the machinery went back with their workers in lorries; the rest took a hell of a pounding from our side."  	As they climbed the stairs, Maurice was wondering if armies chose where to stop more by available comforts for the officers than by the dictates of battle.  Their room was warm, well-appointed, and it had two beds.	Later, clean and wearing some borrowed togs, Maurice wandered downstairs leaving Eric, now in a much repaired mood, the privacy of their room.  Uncharacteristically - as he discovered later, particularly so as it was Boxing Day - the lounge of the hotel was deserted apart from an officer sitting in the far corner.  Maurice waited by the small bar.  No one came.	"Go round and help yourself, tell Henri later."  The officer rose and came towards him.	"Michael Julien."  He held out his hand.  "Welcome to Angoulime.  It's the big push just north that's got everyone in a flap. The mess wouldn't be so thin otherwise."	Maurice introduced himself and briefly explained his and Eric's presence in answer to the question.  He wasn't sure about the man; he had wet lips and a slightly - he couldn't put his finger on it exactly - creepy, yes that was it, creepy manner.  This man  reminded him of a boy scout leader he had fleetingly known and strongly rejected as a twelve year old.  Some things Maurice would never forget - that incident was one of them.	"I'm with Intelligence and local liaison with the French Police in this area.  It was to me your travel request ended up with.  You can thank LeClerc for that, a good man." He finished his drink, slipped behind the bar, refilled his glass and returned to Maurice's side.  "Do you know what this building was until ten days ago?"	Maurice shook his head.  He wasn't sure he liked this man at all.	"Area Gestapo Headquarters.  You want to see the basement?"  He said it as if the thought of what went on down there gave him pleasure.  "There's a lot of tension in the town: the Maquis have the Vichy to sort out; plus, Jerry's dug in a few miles north and looks like holding on for a bit."	Maurice said they had just come from Oise.  	"Never heard of it, old man.  I was sent here from Paris.  Missed some damn good Christmas parties too."	Eric came in and Maurice introduced him. Michael quickly brought him a drink, then took them both through to the dining room.  He talked for the benefit of both men but his eyes were on  Eric.     The meal was excellent, and while eating they learnt more about the area.  It appeared that as the Allies approached, the already nervous Germans fled leaving the town open.  They had been mainly clerks and administrative personnel; most of the Gestapo and their files had already gone.  They had the first call on transport and advance warning of this last Allied push.	"We just took over, lock, stock, and celler."  Michael was pushing the chicken into an already full mouth.  "The chef's from Paris.  Got to give it to old Jerry, he know's how to live."  Maurice thought of Lise.	"What about the factory?"  He had to ask.  Eric looked as if he intended to get drunk again. 	"Don't know who's got it at present, - Donald?"	A young infantry subaltern looked up.  "What was that?"	"The factory, theirs or ours?"     He shrugged.  "Sort of in the middle, really."  He went back to his meal, thought for a moment, then put his fork down.  "Looks like they've been told to hold and now we're pushing more to the East.  Its in a bit of a salient really.  Bloody big place got a hell of a pounding; you won't find much there now."	Eric appeared either not to have heard, or he didn't care.  He finished eating and got up.  "I want to go for a walk."  His voice was slurred, but no one said anything.  Maurice watched him walk out.	"Town's perfectly safe."  said Micheal  who had been watching him, too.  "Nothing to worry about."	The rest of the tables in the room had now filled up and Maurice could see that it was indeed a bit of a squash.  After all it was not a large hotel.  Most of the men were in uniform, but they appeared to be more administrative and staff, than combat officers.      Back in their room ,Maurice lay down, he was tired and and he was worried.  Eric was no longer the Eric he had known; he was unpredictable and a danger to himself and to Maurice.  He sat up.  There was something, too, about this island oasis that, far from comforting him further, had now begun to touch him with fine tendrils of increasing unease.  He stood and walked about the room. Tomorrow they would try to get inside the factory.  Despite all else a report had to be made.  All that was known was that it had made guidance systems and that it had a large research section, now presumably withdrawn into the safety of the Reich.     He decided to find Julien and question him further.  He was not in the hotel; like Eric, he appeared to gone for a walk.  Maurice could not settle; an air of unreality pervaded the hotel. He walked outside into the soft cold darkness and found it there, too, still and rich with premonition. He walked along the cobbled street past a cafe throwing light carelessly onto the pavement as if it knew there was no war here, only changing victors’. A cat hurried by against the wall, Maurice had seen none in Lise.      Inside the café, smoke and muted conversation fermented, thick with plot and names spat out like grey rank meat.  He entered and was an instant long lost friend - the Englishman, the liberator.  But he could hear the echos of the same words, and the same assurances of gratitude and loyalty spoken over the past four years to other men.  This was a town that had survived because it knew the necessary words.       It would keep its truth for itself topurge when the strangers had all gone.  Here there would be many shorn heads and many just and sudden deaths in the spring and summer of the coming year.  It would be a hard harvest of honour, bitter and bloody.   	A man sitting beside him, pushed the cigarette packet open. Maurice declined.  A glass of cognac appeared, the man leant towards him, and whispered a name, if there was anything he required (he emphasised the word anything) then he could get it for him.  He, Roger, could get many things that a gentleman, especially an important man, might need.  Of course, suddenly it was clear to Maurice, he was in civies, yet he was addressed as “sir”. He was at the hotel, therefore he must be important, like the other important men who did not wear uniforms who had been there before him.  Maurice smiled.  He, too, spoke softly, he would remember the name.  He stood up and went out into the street to breathe.	Eric was not yet back.  Maurice went to bed, but he could not sleep.  He lay tending the lonliness and sadness inside him at the loss of his friend.  As he lay blackly with the  silver blade of moonlight stabbing into the room, he thought once again of Ernst.      Where was he now?  And was he still alive? Had he gone to the East?  That had been one of his dreams, to be a reaper of the Communist lies, to plough their false doctrines back into their blood-enriched soil, and to build the homesteads and farms of the Tuetonic Knights as the bulwarks of a new Europe.   He could see Ernst's face and hear the impassioned and eloquent words of his dreams speaking out of the past?  Such dreams were now as surely in ruins as the hubris and industry that had spawned them.        	He heard the door and the unsteady walk; it was Eric returning. Trying to hold his balance, for a moment he stood illuminated in that accusing shaft of silver.  As he slipped the borrowed greatcoat to the floo,r Maurice saw that his flies were undone and that his trousers gaped open.  This was no clumsy urination. This was the work of another hand that by the pale, careless stains had been successsful.      A coldness twisted in Maurice's stomach and he knew a new pain more hurtful than any taunt.  Eric lowered himself onto the bed, belched and instantly began to snore.  Numbly, Maurice lay awake, rejected, betrayed, at risk of death, and if Eric spoke, accountable for a terrible fraud.  The thin dawn and exhaustion brought him short sleep.	They could not get to the factory that day.	"Sorry, just not on.  Its not ours and its not theirs."  The Infantry Captain was adament.  "If I send some men in there and start something I haven't got the fire power to finish it."  He showed Maurice the map.  "That line there and there, that's the push."  The brown gloved finger stabbed east.	"What if the Germans…"  Maurice hesitated.	He shook his head.  "They won't start anything."	Maurice tried again only to receive the look a child gets when he is too young to understand any explanation and must only accept the decision made for him.  He showed his letters and the pass.  The Captain nodded.  	"The minute it’s ours, you go in, not before.  Sorry."	Maurice felt that the greatest sorrow the Captain had was being at the holding salient and not at the eastern push.  He thanked him and returned to the hotel.      Eric was openly derisive.  He demanded to see the proof, if there was any, that the Germans had a sound amplifier.  It was to be the laboratory scenes repeated.	"You lied, didn't you?"  His voice rose.  "You don't want me to finish my work that's why you destroyed it.  You're jealous of me."  He was spitting and dribbling with anger and frustration.  "You've always been jealous of me.  You stole my notes - I saw you had them, you copied them!"  He grabbed at Maurice  who pushed away and onto the bed where Eric lay sobbing in an impotent hysteria.	This time Maurice felt nothing.  He left the room and when he came back Eric had gone.  Then his terror returned that somehow Eric could alert the Ministry to his fraud in continuing the project.  He could no longer even plead that it was successful and that he had some mitigation for his action. For it was not and they had been right to order its termination - the blackened twisted wreakage in the tiny Lab bore mute testimony to that.  No, what he had done was treason and the punishment was death.  The word grew big and terrible in his mind and it mocked his fear of it.	Eric did not return that night, nor the next day.  Maurice set out to find him.  The quiet of a held breath lay still over the town.  But he listened and he heard a word here and a word  there and he went to a house in the Rue Nagy. 	He went to number 15 with the green shutters that were always closed and he waited.   He waited a long time until he saw what he had been told.  He saw Eric come out of the house with a young man, a young man with curly hair, a thin dark mustache dark soft eyes and who walked like a kitten.  He also saw a much younger boy leave the house and after him came Michael Julien.  He followed Eric and the youth to a cafe and he watched them eat.  He watched them taste each other's food and share their drinks and he knew that they were lovers.  Later, cold inside and out he watched them return to the house in the Rue Nagy.  For three days he came to watch them come and go so that he was sure.     On the fourth day the push to the east happened, the Germans fell back and the salient collapsed.  Maurice went to the house with the green shutters and told the young man who came to the door to bring Eric out.  He came, leaning with his old arrogance against the paint flaking frame.	"I have the proof, tomorrow we can go in."  And Eric nodded, he would be there.	Maurice went back to the hotel and waited.  In the morning Eric arrived early, even before the jeep came for them.  The captain had been as good as his word.  There were four men led by a corporal to go before them, just in case.	The factory was a gaunt brick building that had once been the home of an engineering company that made electrical motors and parts for ships and then for trucks and cars.  The Germans took it over and put its labour force to work on radio transmitters and field receivers for tanks.  They brought in specialists for the newly built wing from Germany and from their  conquered western lands.  Here they wound gyroscopes and put together guidance systems for the pilotless planes and for the new vengeance weapons that rocketed down on an unwarned London.  	Now  there was little left: the roof gaped holes; much of the machinery had gone; the rest was twisted by wilful departing sabotage.  The doors were open, the windows flapped. The filing cabinets spilled paper on the abandoned office floor.  The drawing room was ashed by rapid burning, but not all had burnt.  Eric believed he'd found a valve, a heavy half burnt fused transformer.  It could be here - there was hope.  He dug and poked about.  He neither looked nor talked to Maurice.     There was a sudden small, but sharp explosion and a shout from the room above. Maurice rushed out to meet the corporal coming down calling for the medic.  He went up.  On the floor a soldier writhed the blood gushing from his shattered chest.  Another held him pressing down with inadequate dressings.   	"Get out!"  But Maurice looked.  Part of the man's arm still holding the door handle lay among the rubble.  "Get out the place is booby trapped!"  The soldier was shouting at him.  "Go down the stairs."       Maurice ran back.  He saw Eric stand and look at him, then at the tilted part open safe.  A roll of blueprints tempted.  Maurice now knew why.  He opened his mouth.  Eric moved to the safe.  	"No!"  whispered Maurice all force stolen from his body.  	He saw Eric draw out the roll and the door swing open.  The tongue of flame leaped out and covered Eric. Its harsh, hot breath threw Maurice back out of the door and into the roaring darkness.	A medic held his head.  "Can you move?"  Maurice could; he was shaky, but he could move.  He stood up.  He was bruised and winded, nothing more.     The corporal held his arm.  "There'll be hell over this."  He was worried.  "You're mates had it."  Brutally said, but not meant that way.        Maurice moved toward the door.     "No! You don't want to see." 	He shook the man free.  He did want to see.  He looked in and his vomit splashed onto the floor.  The soldier caught his arm again and led him carefully to the jeep. He passed out again.     	"You'll be right as rain old man; just gave you a shot.  You'll sleep the clock round."  The words ran into each other. The bed was warm and so soft.  A hand stroked his head; his mother was leaning over him.  He could hear the shouts of the other children in the street.  He'd wanted to play with them.  They chased him away and he went back.  Tommy Wiggens threw the brick at him.  He saw it coming right to his head and then the black silence pulled him under.	It was mid-morning, light came into the room.  He was in bed, his clothes were folded on the chair.  He waited, nothing hurt, then the memory came back.  He saw the fire reach out to purify and halo the standing man.  He saw the heavy safe door crashing into Eric's body folding and flinging it backwards to land brokenly in the rubble.  He heard the room roaring and he was  screaming and flailing backwards.  The memory stopped, rewound.   He remembered the soldier’s warning. Eric reached out, paused and looked at him, but Maurice said nothing. He shook his head. He said nothing and Eric died lying among the bricks looking like a cat run over in the street - burst, mis-shapen, glass-eyed.	"I killed Eric."  No one replied.  He said it again.  There was just the room and the sound of a little rain and the noises from the road outside.      There was no feeling.  He got up.	Downstairs people were walking about.  There were a couple of officers in the lounge.	"Lunch, sir?"  The maid smiled at him, his French was good and she appreciated that.	He meant to say no, but he was hungry. "Ah, oui, merci."  She bobbed and went away. He went into the lounge.  	"How are you old chap?"  He hadn't noticed the adjutant in the corner.  "Doc said you'd be alright."	"Fine, thank you."  Maurice sat down beside him.  "Still a bit tired."	"Bad show what. Damned sorry.   Friend was he?"	"I'd known him a while." 	"Yes, well."  	Both men fell silent.  There wasn't anything else to say.	Later he bumped into Michael Julien. Would Maurice mind writing a report on what had happened.  The French needed it and one would have to go back to the Ministry.  Maurice didn't mind.	Julien read it through.  "You can't write that."  He crossed out 'I failed to warn Eric Simms of the booby trap.'  	"But its true." said Maurice.	"Did you try to warn him?"  Maurice said he had.	"Then you didn't fail.  Write it out again.  There's a good fellow." exonerate 	Maurice didn't argue further and he wrote it out again.  He did however, the corporal and his men from any blame as far as he could.  "What happened to the soldier?"	Julien shook his head.  "He didn't make it."  He read it through, signed the bottom and put it into his pocket.  "What are you going to do now?"	Maurice had no idea.  "Wait for orders I suppose."     Julien nodded, "Good a place as any to wait."	Eric Simms’ body had been taken by the military, to be buried nearby.  	Maurice wrote a careful letter to Mrs.Simms and to Jane.  He did not confess anything to them.  There would have been no point.5th. January 1989.     Matthew turned the envelope over nothing on the back.  On the front, his name and the shop address, typed, posted NW3, and franked 6pm on the fourth.  He read the letter again – that, too, was typed with no signature.     “You know who I am.      I am sorry I underestimated you.  Call your man off.       Please!      I would have told you about Eric Simms, but my brother needed me and anyway I didn't see why I should.   He was not part of our bargain.  But, for what it is worth, this is all I know.     Simms and your father had been lovers in England.  When I met them in Angoulime they had fallen out.  I introduced Simms to some friends of mine, he was very depressed and needed cheering up. I believe your father was very jealous.  A few days later Simms was killed by an accident in a factory on the outskirts of the town.  Your father believed he was responsible for the accident and that he had killed Simms.  Neither the soldiers who accompanied nor the French investigator felt this to be true.  He tried to write a report implicating himself in the death.  I made him change it.  In this incident he was blameless.  Believe me, I don't know any more.     Please, leave us alone.”     Something had really frightened Michael Julien.  This was not the superior and arrogant person he had spoken to the day before.  But who and what had frightened him?      "Call your man off," he had written.     Matthew was puzzled.  If he was right and he had caught a glimpse of the Tall Man in St. Martin's Square, and if he was the same one who had been watching him and the shop, why had he done something to so frighten Julien?  What was the connection?     Julien surely had nothing to do with the Chasseur.     Unless the Tall Man thought that Matthew had taken it to Julien.     Then what was so special about a book worth £400 at the most?     So far he had no answer to that.     However he did however have an answer, to why Maurice had protected Simms' experimental work.  Whether Matthew liked it or not, it made sense.  So did Maurice's feelings of guilt.  If you cared for someone and they betrayed you and were killed, guilt was very likely.  Especially if you had wished them dead for the hurt you had received.     Well, that appeared to tidy the Simms episode up.  Though why Maurice had the notes to all the experiments was not clear.  That he had kept them, once he had them, was probably sentiment.  The same with the photo of the two of them playing tennis au naturelle.     Matthew placed the letter in the file with his notes and the time line.     He looked at his note pad.    “'Check accounts," he read.     He was certainly happier doing that now that he knew that the money was clean.  Well, cleaner, He very much doubted if Julien actually paid for those books.   No, that would have been up to Maurice to pay.  Part of the favour for a favour.     He opened the drawer and took out the wad of statements.   They went back five years.  The older one's had probably been thrown away, or filed in the attic.  The attic. That was somewhere else to check out.  People often dumped the detritus of their lives in attics.  He made a note to do that on the pad and turned back to the task in hand.     Well, Jenny was right; January and February were not good months.  Very little had been deposited in those months in any of the years.  The summer appeared best, and then the period just before Christmas.  But what was this December 31st deposit?     He checked again.  There it was, every 31st.  Not exactly the same amount, but close to £2000.       He looked at the code on the foot of the statement.  It wasn't a deposit, but a transfer?  From where?     He picked up the phone.     "Martins bank, good morning, how can I help you?"     "This is Mr. Vigor, account 42355647.   Can you tell me if £2000 was transfered to the account on 31st. December?"     "One moment sir," the line clicked and ghastly musak began, mercifully brief.     "You have an account enquiry, Mr. Vigor?"     Matthew repeated the request.     "Yes sir, the exact amount was £1987.67 credited on the 31st."     "Could you confirm the origin of that transfer please?"  Matthew had his fingers crossed.  There was silence.     "Credit Mobilier, 2 Rue D'Etoile Paris.   The converted amount was 200,000 francs."     "Thank you," said Matthew and hung up.     Now another mystery.  Why was 200,000 francs being credited to Maurice's account every year?  And for how long?     He dialed International enquiries and got the number for Credit Mobilier.     There his luck stopped.     He was stone walled right up to the manager to whom he had insisted on speaking to.     Yes, he may well be Mr. Vigor, even Mr. M. Vigor but he was not Maurice Vigor and he did not have the account number.     They were unable to help.     Matthew had given up counting the number of J”e suis desole, mais…” that had been offered him.     He would have to either find the account number or have all the necessary papers to allow him access to the deceased's account.     "Bugger and bollocks."     He picked up the phone again.     "Harry Franks, please," he may as well deal with the next item on his list, get a divorce solicitor.     "Good morning, Mr. Vigor and a Happy New Year," Franks was as fast and as bouncy as ever.     Matthew explained the situation and Franks listened.     "We could have a problem with that one," he said when Matthew had finished.  "At some time you will have to swear an affidavit with regard to your assets.   But you tell me that you would prefer, quite understandably, that your wife did not know about the inheritance et cetera.  Now I would have a difficulty attesting to any affidavit made by you that didn't include this inheritance and its probable value.  Now I am not saying that she has a claim to it.  However, it is likely, given its ultimate value - the flat, the shop, stock and bank deposits - that she would try to make a claim.  Do you follow me?"     Matthew did.     "What I suggest is that you find another solicitor to deal with this matter and I forget that we ever spoke about it.  Of course, should you ever want, how shall I say, informal advice, a second opinion, I shall be only too happy to help."     Matthew thanked him.  Oh well, back to the Yellow Pages.     He chose a firm close to Eddie's flat, why raise suspicions?  He was able to get an appointment for that afternoon.  That could mean that they were either very good or that no one used them because they weren't.  Well, he'd no doubt find out.     Having finished his list.  Apart from buying a bottle of scotch for Jack, he went down to the shop.          Jenny, who looked  tired and had dark rings under her eyes, was well into the journals and had a stack of notes at her elbow.  The sale notice was still up, but now applied only to the inside shelf and it appeared to have lost its pulling power.     "Dull day with drizzle, people in a hurry and nothing to catch the eye," she said.  "Also people feel trapped when they come inside, as if they have to buy.  The trays are best."     "We'll put them out on good days, then," said Matthew.     "And lose anything worth more than 50p?  I think we even had a few of those grow legs yesterday because the amounts don't tally."     "Can't win," said Matthew.  "Did we lose much?"     "Not a lot.  Your father said that the clergy and respectable professional men, especially teachers, were the worst for stealing books."     Matthew laughed.     "No, I'm serious. The evidence is bourne out by library loss statistics.  Theological colleges have the worst record."     Matthew still found it funny.  But it did not appear to amuse Jenny in the least.     "Got much from the journals?"     "An overall impression, yes, up to December 1944."     "And?"     "I feel very sorry for him.  He was very lonely.  Especially when he came back from Germany.  He went on for pages about its strength and new found honour and purpose, the way they had solved unemployment and we hadn't."     "The thuggery and violence?" said Matthew.     "He didn't see any, certainly didn't mention it.  He never knew his father who was killed in August 1917, his mother wasn't married and Maurice suffered a great stigma.  He was brought up by her and her parents in a poky little shop in East London.  He hated being poor and the pointlessness of his clerking job which was the best he could get with his education."     "Not a great start to life," said Matthew, thinking of the relative ease of his own childhood.          "He met Ernst again in Paris in June of 1938 for a weekend.  Talks about a lot of photos."     "No sign of them," said Matthew.     "Not in the journals,” said Jenny. “September 1939 he wrote that Germany was not the enemy, but that we should look to the East and within."     "Sounds like he had picked up a lot from his trip to The Third Reich."     "He and Ernst wrote weekly right up to the outbreak of war.  He really missed those letters after that."     "I wonder what happened to them?  I bet they would be interesting to read," Matthew for the moment was thinking as an historian.     "He had a funny sort of interview in June 1940 and then was transfered to Fenton Street and the MOD in that November.  He appears to have really enjoyed that work."     "Was he still opposed to the war?"     "He doesn't mention that much, not directly, more on the details of what he was doing and who he met."     "Eric Simms."     "Yes, saw him first in late November 1940.  They got on well, at first.  Christmas 1940 at Posthill in Brighton.  Then there's a lot that is difficult to make out, very cryptic.  Then something about a mistake in December 1941, misfiling and I quote,     'Eric must be allowed to continue, he is a great scientist and I am happy to serve him as best I can', unquote."      Matthew raised an eyebrow.      "Simms appears to have been a very manic worker - up one day, down the next.  Their relationship was good when the work went well, when it didn't he took it out on Maurice.  Oh, and there are some long passages on literature.  It appears that Maurice was bent on self improvement, apart from keeping his German up to scratch.  I think he had quite an inferiority complex and very low self esteem."     "Thank you, Dr. Freud," said Matthew.       Jenny looked at him and then continued.     "Some very bad times were spent at Maddingly after the failure of a major experiment in Summer of 1944.  Simms began to blame Maurice for what was going wrong.  Simms had a nervous breakdown and Maurice nursed him back to health spending time with him whenever he could get away from his work.  Then there's a very harrowing section.  It's the last peice I have read.     "You've developed quite an empathy for him haven't you?" said Matthew.     "He writes brilliantly at times, honest, insightful and with real pain.  If you read the original you would see what I mean."     Matthew nodded, "Go on, please," he said gently hoping to mollify her and suceeding.     "Maurice is posted to liberated France.  He suspects, rightly I think, that Simms was going to expose whatever it was Maurice had done to keep his work going.  He manages to get Simms transfered to France with him.  They have a terrible time.  Danger, shortage of rations, Simms in a constant depression and drinking heavily.  I don't know how Maurice managed, poor man.  Finally, at Angoulime Simms went off with a Frenchman for three days."     Jenny looked at Matthew.  "You can't imagine the pain it caused your father.  I was reading until 3am and then I couldn't sleep.  Angoulime sounds like a terrible place.  Then there was the accident. I think it nearly drove him mad.  Simms walked into a booby trap, Maurice had tried to warn him, but too late.  For pages and pages he goes over it."     Jenny opened the journal on the desk and turned to the page she had marked with a sheet of paper.     "Look, 'I killed him, it was me,' there and there, repeated over and over again."  Her voice broke and for a moment Matthew thought she was going to cry.     He closed the journal and put his arm round her shoulder.     "I'm sorry," he said, "I never thought it would upset you this much."     She shook her head, "It's alright, I'm just tired.  But the poor man, I really understand how he feels.  What he writes comes right out of the page at me."  She sniffed and then smiled at Matthew.  "Take no notice, I always cry at sad films.  When I was twelve I cried for days after reading 'Little Women'."        "I think we will close for lunch, fancy a sandwich, on me?"     Jenny smiled, "I'd prefer a plate."     That broke the spell of the journal and they both laughed.     "Come on, and if you don't feel up to this afternoon we'll stay shut.  If we are customerless open we may as well be customerless shut and you can catch up on your sleep."     They lunched at the Oxford Arms and neither mentioned the journal or anything else to do with Maurice.  They kept to the neutral subjects and current events.     The shop stayed shut after lunch and Jenny went home while Matthew saw the solicitor.  He did not particularly take to the man, who by the smell had also lunched at a pub and incessantly smoked small black cheroots.  However, having listened to Matthew and having read the letters he agreed it was all fairly straight forward and should not be a problem.     "There are no children of the marriage?"     "No," said Matthew.     "Good, that makes it easier and considerably cheaper for you."     "You are happy with a fifty-fifty split on the flat?"     Matthew said he was.     "Will she buy you out or you her?     He and Sue had not discussed this and the solicitor made a note.     "If neither of you want it, then sell and divi up?"     Matthew nodded.       Another note was made.     "And you have only your teaching salary, which is?"     Matthew told him.     "No savings, investments, property?"     "No," said Matthew.     "And your wife works as a sub Editor, salary?"     "About £17,000," said Matthew.     "Does she have property, apart from her share in the flat?  Is it in joint names?     "Not that I know of, and yes, it is."     "Well, we'll ask for full disclosure.  Now are there any items you particularly want or are solely yours in the marriage?"     "Some books, records, I bought the stereo."     "Make a list and let me have it.  Well, that does it for the moment.  I'll write to the other side and we'll get the ball rolling."  He stood up and held out his hand.  It was a weak handshake.     On the way back Matthew bought a bottle of Malt for Jack and a generic scotch for himself.  He was no connoisseur of spirits, but some times a stiff one helped.  He grinned inwardly, chance would be a fine thing, he thought.     Having brought his notes up to date on Maurice and with a simple stew on the stove - Matthew had no liking for precooked convenience meals, he sat down and switched on the TV.     He caught the end of a banal game show, an episode of Neighbours and then the news.       The first item froze him to his chair.     "The police were called to a house in St. Martin's Square in North West London this afternoon where the bodies of two men were found beaten to death.”      Matthew sat in disbelief.     Then the picture was of the Square zooming in on the front of number 45.  He listened in growing horror.     "Inside this house in this peaceful square, the naked and bound bodies of Mr. Michael Julien, aged 75 and his brother David, 63 were found by police this afternoon.  The call came from a neighbour who had heard loud music and screams coming from what she described as a normally quiet house.  Both men had been suffocated with plastic shopping bags and their badly beaten bodies had been tied together back to back.  Every room had been ransacked and the police believe that that robbery was the motive.  Detective Inspector Hanson has appealed to anyone who may have information to ring Hampstead Police on..."     The number was drowned out by the telephone.  Matthew jumped at it knocking the body of the phone to the floor.  He sorted out the tangle without losing the call.     "Have you heard the news?" it was Jenny.     "On now," said Matthew keeping his voice steady.     "The man, Michael Julien, he was the person who rang to speak to you the day before yesterday."     "Yes," said Matthew, "he was.  He wanted to know about a book."     "Oh," said Jenny, "But he asked specifically for you and insisted that you ring back."       "Yes, and I did," Matthew was thinking fast, "Turned out not to be important, but I may as well let the police know, just in case."     "Yes, right, well I just wondered if you had heard. It's terrible, isn't it?"     "Terrible," he said.     "See you tomorrow then, bye."     "Thanks, bye."     He hung up.       "More terrible than you think Jenny, far more."     There was nothing more about it on the news and Matthew turned off the TV.     He sat nursing a drink.  Guilt?  No that was silly, why should he feel guilt.  Yes, he could happily of killed Michael Julien, but not in reality.  That was just a way of grounding emotions, saying you would do something that you knew you could never actually do.  And certainly not that way.  That was sick, as if someone had enjoyed the killings, not just killed.  Then Matthew thought of the girl in the book.  He took a mouthful of the scotch, but that didn't help.     Should he tell the police?  Or wait and see if they contacted him?  Perhaps he could just say he had spoken with Julien about a book on the phone.  But what if someone had noticed him at the house?  He had to admit to himself that he was afraid.       An hour later he was still undecided when the phone rang again and broke his musings.     "Hallo."     "Matthew Vigor," the voice was female, softly accented and friendly.     "Yes," he said.     "My name is Marion Zollman.  I really need to talk to you."     "Yes," said Matthew again.     "I'm only in London for a short while.  Can we meet?"     "Well, yes, of course, when?"     "Tonight, if that is possible, it is very important."     "Tonight?"  Matthew was not keen to see anyone tonight, however pleasant their voice.      "It's about a book, the Chasseur d'Amour and about your late father, Maurice Vigor."       I don't believe this, thought Matthew.       "I am not far away.  I could come to you unless you would prefer to come to my hotel."     "No, you can come here.  The address is..."     "I have the address, say ten minutes."      The line clicked as the phone was put down.      He pushed his case under the table and pulled the roll top down on the desk. The stew was still in the pan, uneaten, gas off.     Tidy enough for visitors.     He went to the window and pulled the curtain back a fraction.     The street went noisily about its normal busines. He watched.  A cab pulled up outside and a woman got out.  She came to door and he was well down the stairs when the bell rang.     "Matthew Vigor?"  even in the yellow light she was attractive.     He closed the door behind her.     "Please go up.  Mind the stairs, they are steep."     She walked up ahead of him conscious that he was watching her body move, closely and with pleasure.     "Please go through," he indicated the chair and sat opposite her.     "Thank you for seeing me," she sat with her legs together slightly angled, her skirt breaking just above the knees.  The light coloured blouse exposed her neck and the material shaped to her breasts and nipples.  The jacket was expensively cut.  No top coat, he thought.  Hotel to taxi to here, she didn't walk, tube or bus.     "I'm Marion Zollman, my uncle is David Zollman, of Amsterdam."     The way she said it suggested to Matthew that he should know the name or react in some way.     "Yes," he said.  Her perfume was gently scenting the room.  She was wearing no jewelry.  "You mentioned a book and my father."  No point in beating about the bush, he thought.     She hesitated.  Her mouth opened slightly showing the tips of white even teeth that chewed for a moment on her lip.  Her eyes slide softly over his face, then down to her hands folded on her lap.     Matthew experienced a surge of want for her, all the stronger for his long abstinence.     "It is a long story and not altogether a pleasant one."  Her voice held him in thrall.   Perfect English, so soft and the edges of the words rounded, rolling towards him like smooth warm stones on a beach.     "Would you like a drink, scotch?"     She smiled, "That would be nice."     He tried not to let his bones melt in front of her.  He opened the Malt and poured two glasses.  As he handed one to her,  her fingers brushed his. Unconsiously?     "Why not start at he beginning," he said wishing he had ironed his shirt.     She took a small sip at the Malt, delicate, like a cat and then held the glass on her lap.     "My uncle's family has lived in Amsterdam for many generations.  They were, are, diamond merchants.  In 1940, the Germans occupied the city and rounded up the Jews, especially those who could contribute to their needs."     "Like diamond merchants," said Matthew.     "The Germans took all they could, and not only diamonds, but paintings, rare books, even furniture.  Any who opposed them were killed."  She spoke without emotion, recounting the facts simply.  "My uncle's father and an elder brother were killed.  My uncle was sent with his mother and other members of the family to a concentration camp. His younger brother, my father, was away when they came that day for the family and he escaped."     She took another sip from the glass.  Matthew sat mesmerised.     "The younger brother eventually came to Palestine.  Later, in Israel, he married, I was born, and grew up there.  When I was twenty-three I went to Amsterdam to work for my uncle.  That was six years ago."     "So you are a diamond merchant?"     "No, I am his secretary and he is an old man.  He has a mission to fulfil and I try to help him.  He wants to get his family back."     Matthew did not understand.     "The flesh and blood is gone, save for my father.  But the possessions, the Zollman inheritance, that still exists."     "Diamonds?"     She shook her head, "They are only commodities.  He has been trying, since he was released from Austwitz, to trace and recover all that was taken.  The paintings, the books, the antiques that had been in the family, that gave it its tangible history and memories - it is these he searches for.  He is not without means."     "Rich," thought Matthew.     "Every catalogue, every sale room is scrutinised. I travel all over Europe, even to America."     "Can they be identified?"     She nodded, "Most are marked, all were recorded."     "But what if you find something?"     "Then I offer to buy it back."     "And if people won't sell?"     "Then I offer more, as much as is necessary."     "The Chasseur d'Amour belonged to your uncle?"     "He believes so.  If there is an impression of a diamond circled by a snake on the bottom of page 32, then it belongs to his family."     "And he believes that my father had this book?"     "Yes, and others. He sold books in Paris after the war.  Some were similar such books."     "Looted by the Nazis?"     "Yes."     "And you think my father knew this?"     "I will be honest with you Matthew.  Yes, I think he did."     Matthew sat still, but his insides twisted and turned.       "You do have the Chasseur."  She was looking straight at him.     "No," he said, "I don't."     "I see," there was great disappointment in her voice, disappointment in him.     "But I know where it is, although I do not know if it has the diamond and snake marking."     The smile lit her face and shone on him.     He explained about the probate and the bank.       She nodded, "But you could check page 32?"     Yes, he could do that.  Would she now answer some questions?  She happily agreed.     "How long has your uncle known my father had the book?"     "Since the end of the war."     "Did he ask my father to sell it?"     "Yes."     "Why didn't he?"     "I don't know."     "So he waited until my father died to try again?"     Marion nodded.     "Just before Christmas a man called.  He demanded that I get the Chasseur for him."     "That is Willi he works for my uncle.  He was in London then, I was in America."     "He was not pleasant."     "I'm sorry, he does not mean to be.  It is just his manner.  He is back in Amsterdam now."     Since when? Thought Matthew, but he didn't ask.     "The book is not valuable."     "Not in money, no, but I can offer you £1000 for it."     Matthew looked surprised.     "You have been inconvenienced by all this, it is compensation."     "I want to know more about my father."     "I do not know any more, but my uncle does."     "Would he talk to me?"     "He does not travel, he is too frail."     Matthew was thinking.     "But, he would see you," she smiled at him, "If you came to Amsterdam and I could show you the city unless you have been before."     "No," said Matthew, "I haven't."     "Then it can be arranged." She took a card from her pocket, "This is my number, you can call me."  She moved slightly handing it to him.  There was more leg in view.     Something was not being said.  He had the feeling he had been maneuvered some how, but he could not put his finger on exactly what it was.       "Now I must go.  I have taken enough of your time," she stood up and held out her hand. "I am grateful.  Thank you, Matthew."     Her scent remained  after she had gone fading slowly in the warm room.  His unease didn't; it grew stronger as his doubts multiplied.  Why had Willie, aka the Tall Man, not called back as he had said he would?  When had he left London for Amsterdam?  Yesterday? late yesterday?  Why had she not questioned the Probate issue more deeply?  Had she wanted him to suggest he spoke to her uncle?  And then there were the other books she had spoken of, the ones Maurice had sold in Paris.  Was the Chasseur the last one?  Or was it the tip of some hidden iceberg, some secret stash of looted books?     Well, first thing tomorrow he would ring the bank to check page 32.      He picked up her glass.  There was a faint trace of lipstick on the very edge of the ring.  He poured what was left of the malt into his glass and drained it.  He would need something to help him sleep.  He would have to buy another bottle for Jack. 7th. January 1989.     For the second night since Marion's visit Matthew had not slept well.  She had certainly disturbed him.  Not her herself, though he would confess an attraction if anyone had pressed him.    What disturbed him more was what she had said, or not said, for that had raised many questions in his mind.  It would have been easier if some of them had been less ephemeral and more concrete.  But however he went over them the questions refused to solidify.     He stood waiting for the coffee to percolate watched by the Orange Cat who at least knew when to stop insisting.  This morning it would be coffee first and feed the cat second.     Perhaps he should get Dr. Hamilton's prescription dispensed.  As much as Matthew disliked pills he could do with some gentle tranquilizing, especially between 11pm and 7 am.     The percolating began and the coffee aroma rose toward him promising an erzsatz alertness.  Today had to be better than yesterday, when he had achieved nothing.     Franks had had little help to offer.  There was no legal way to get the Chasseur from the bank without the Probate Court's approval and that would take time.  They weren't even back from the Christmas recess yet and any special pleading would have to be done before a judge.     "I'd have to brief a barrister to plead for you and they do not come cheap.  I suggest you just let time take its course."     Matthew had thanked Franks and left it at that.     Surprisingly, the bank had been more helpful, they could photostat page thirty-two for him.  There would be an administrative charge, of course, but they would have the photostat posted to him as soon as possible.     So, apart from two hours and one customer in the shop while Jenny went to the hairdressers, that was yesterday.     He poured a cup of coffee and cooled it from the tap and drank it in three gulps.     "Okay, you next," he rummaged about for the tin opener and spooned the glop onto 'O.C's.' plate.  He wondered if Eddie had any post for him - he would have rang if he had.     He forced himself to munch on a piece of bread before savouring his next cup of coffee, an acid stomach he could do without.  He was due to spend the morning in the shop. Jenny had planned to go through the cellar novels and  code them for sale upstairs.  She may as well, he thought; they are not doing anything down there.     He sat by the fire with his legs out while a now replete and windy OC sprawled out in his favourite position, belly to the flames.     Why offer £1000 for the Chasseur? Damn it, he hadn't been that inconvenienced - one rude caller. Unless, of course, Marion knew a lot more than she had said.  Did she know he had been to the Julien's?  There had been a quarter page in the National's yesterday and a brief reference in the news.  But now, a threatened tube strike had taken over as the lead story.  So far no suspects and no sensations of perversions.  The police must have found the three books and probably more, but they were keeping that to themselves.     "What did they say?"  Jenny had asked as soon as she came in yesterday.     "Nothing much," he lied, "Thank you for calling and we will contact you if necessary."     And that had been that.     He sipped his coffee.  If his father had sold looted books - and that was yet to be proven - where had he got them?  Random purchases of his own to stock the shop that were then sold on?  Or had he been supplied with them, and by whom?  Or had he bought them in bulk?     "These and other questions..." he muttered.     Angoulime,  kept cropping up; he needed to know something about the place.  Where to find out?  A French gazetteer, that would be a start; a modern one  would give a brief historical summary.  What he needed was a good library.     Yellow pages, libraries, he could ring a few and see what turned up.  He reached out for the directory grabbing it by its edge.  It slipped and he just managed to save it falling.  He pulled it onto his lap open at Private Investigators.  An advert leaped out at him.     'Discrete enquiries, home and abroad, accounts traced, businesses investigated.  Call Commercial Enquiries, 24 hours.'     Worth a try.  He reached for the phone, dialed and got only a long squawk. He had dialed the fax number, he tried again.     "Commercial Enquiry."     "I want to trace the origin of a money transfer to a bank account," he said.     The line clicked at him.     "Have you used us before, sir?"     "No," said Matthew.     "May I ask how you obtained our number?"     "Yellow Pages."     "Thank you, sir. Country of receiving account?"     "England."     "Originating country?"     "France."     "Just one account?"     "Yes."     "Do you have the account number?"     "Only the receiving account, but I know the sending bank and the account name."     "Have you tried them personally?"     "Yes, they refused me any details."     "We should be able to solve that, sir.  Our basic fee is £250 for that information if we satisfy your request.  £25 to cover costs should we fail, though I must say that is very rare.  How would you wish to pay?"     Matthew thought quickly, "Credit card," he said.     "That is satisfactory, may I have your card details first, please."     Matthew gave them.     "How do you wish the charge to appear?"     "I'm sorry? Matthew was confused.     "On the bill, sir.  Do you wish it to show the Agency or to be to something less obvious, say a garage or a shop?"     "The Agency will be fine."     "May I now have the receiving bank details and the account number, then the account name and the originating bank."     Matthew gave the information repeating them as requested.     "Thank you, sir.  Will that be all?"     "Yes," he said. "How long will it take?"     "About two to four hours, sir.  Do you want the reply faxed or by phone?"     "Phone is fine," he gave the flat number.  "If I'm out leave it on the answer machine."     "Yes, sir.  Thank you for using us."     And that was that.  Expensive, but it would be one less question chasing about in his head.  He didn't bother to wonder how they could do what he could not - tricks of the trade no doubt.     "Ah well, time to hit the shop," he turned the fire down to a quarter, OC looked nearly done.     Jenny was not in yet and he went straight to the alarm and turned it off. He drew the bolts back and unlocked the front door but left the closed sign up.  He took the post to the desk, most of it was shop stuff still addressed to Maurice Vigor.       He riffled through them, one for him.  He left the rest for Jenny on the desk.  He slit the envelope.   The note was from 'Posthill', Brighton, in a thin scrawly hand, quite brief.     'Dear Matthew Vigor,                        Thank you for your letter.  I am sorry to hear of the death of your father.  I knew Maurice as a close friend of my brother Eric and last heard from him on Eric's death in December 1944.                          I remember Maurice as an intense young man who always appeared to be concerned to give the correct impression, if you know what I mean.  He spent a couple of Christmass with us and, I believe, quite some time with Eric in Cambridge.  They were in many ways very different to each other, but did share a certain commonality.                        I then believed and still do, that Maurice always had Eric's best interest at heart.  I am sorry not to be more helpful.                        Sincerely,                       Anne Littler (nee Simms.)     A nice way of putting it thought Matthew - 'a certain commonality'.  However, it doesn't take me further than I already am.          Jenny arrived and hung her coat in the corner.     "Cup of tea?" she said filling the kettle.  "Anything in the post?"     "I left it for you," said Matthew, except a letter from Eric's sister saying he and Maurice were good friends.     "We know that," Jenny came to the desk "I'll go through these and then descend into Hades.  I didn't get much more translated last night.  He's getting very difficult to read, almost a code.  I only had a couple of hours at it as I had to go out."     "That's okay said Matthew. "Please don't feel pressured. I mean you're not being paid for it, not that I won't."     "Don't be silly, I enjoy it.  Anyway I've found out a couple of things.  Firstly, Maurice was given that book, the Chasseur, by a boy who had originally given it to Eric as some sort of love token.  When Eric died, the boy must have got it back somehow and given it to Maurice.  I think the boy wanted protection from others in the town and thought the English could give it to him.  Maurice described him as a collaborator, among other things.  Not that it did the boy much good because Maurice was sent on to Germany.  However, and this is the second point, before Maurice left he had struck up a friendship with an old man in Angoulime who ran a second hand bookshop.  It appears from the journal that it was this man who got Maurice into the antique book business."     Matthew looked confused, "What set him up in business?"     "No," said Jenny, "taught him about the antiquarian booktrade.  Maurice spent about three weeks in the shop.  He went there every day soaking up knowledge like a sponge. Titles, bindings, pricing, catalogues, bibliographies, everything."     "Well, well, that is interesting, " said Matthew.     "He left the Chasseur and some other books he bought with the old man when he went to Germany.  He told him to post them to him if he wrote.  Otherwise, if he was not heard from for a year, the old man was to sell them.  I suppose he thought that there was a chance he may be killed."     Matthew nodded, deep in thought.  It also meant that he didn't value the Chasseur as much as he did later.  What was it that changed his mind about the book?     "Well, I'm off to the World of Shades," said Jenny putting his cup on the desk.  She had her's in one hand, a pad of A4 paper precariously under her arm as she vanished down the stairs.     So a bookseller in Angoulime taught you the trade, thought Matthew.  Funny how all roads lead, and for some end, in Angoulime.       "Right, let's go hunting," he reached for the phone and the directory.     Six libraries later he struck gold.  They had an up-to-date detailed Gazetteer of France.  So far all he had located were excerpts from the Guide Michelin.     "Where exactly are you situated?" he asked the librarian.     "Colchester," said the voice.     "Oh shit," said Matthew then apologized embarrassingly.     "What exactly did you want to know, there's half a page on Angoulime."     "Well, I'm okay on where and population.  I just wanted a sort of background and anything on the Second World War," he said.     "I can read the headings and the main points," said the man helpfully.     "Thanks," said Matthew grabbing a pencil and adjusting the pad for writing.     "Founded eleventh century, farming and river trade, thirteenth century cathedral, pilgrimage site in sixteenth century, then there's more on trade."     "No," said Matthew.     "Festival of Saints."     "No."     "Bureau of Commerce."     "No."     "Ah, site of fierce fighting in Second World War, briefly a salient holding up the Allied advance in December 1944."     "Yes," said Matthew, "Go on."     "That's it.  Oh no, a couple more lines.  Also the site of an SS atrocity in September 1944 when 26 civilians were massacred by an SS Captain in a reprisal against the population.  A monument to the victims was erected in the Cathedral in 1963."     "That's it?"     "That's it."     "Any other modern references to Angoulime?"     "A history published in 1927, looks like it's a bit of a backwater.  There will be references to it in Official War Histories and in the History of the Occupation of France.  Unfortunately we don't have either series.  You could try the University of Essex."     He gave Matthew the number.     "Thanks for your help."     "Pleasure."     Matthew hung up and looked at his notes.  Well, the fighting tied in with the date of Maurice and Eric being there.  He wondered what the massacre was about, but decided that it was probably irrelevant to his enquiries.     He put his notes with the Posthill letter as the door bell clanged a rush of business.  Two people, Matthew had already learnt, in early January was a rush.     A young couple came to the desk, list in hand.  Did he have any of the following?  They passed the list to him and Matthew began searching the shelves.  He surprised himself how well he now knew his way about the stock.  He returned to the desk with four of the seven books they wanted.     The girl began to sort out her money, the man was looking at him.     "You've a lot of books in your Nazi section," he said in a flat voice.     Matthew looked up at him, "That section offers historical attempts to deal with world problems from a right wing perspective.  The next section along covers Marxism and Communism."  He had kept his tone and pitch neutral though he had taken an immediate dislike to the man.     "Most shops don't have that."      "Most shops don't have what?" asked Matthew.     "A good selection of fascist books, just shelves of left wing propaganda."  The voice was still flat, the face without identifiable expression.  "You don't have a signed Mein Kampf do you?"     For a moment Matthew was stunned by the request, he'd expected argument, objection, anything but that.     "No," he said, "I don't."     "Pity.  Still, this one'll do." The man passed Matthew an unsigned copy in German.     "You read German?"  Matthew couldn't help asking.     "No."     Matthew wrote the prices and titles on the sale sheet, bagged the books and gave the change.     "Thank you," said the girl with a smile.     They walked to the door, the man held it open for her and then turned. Matthew looked up from the desk.  The man threw up his right arm, froze, then dropped the arm, turned on his heel and pulled the door shut behind him.     Matthew sat stunned.       Had that been a joke?  He had the unpleasant feeling it hadn't.     He was still sitting, wondering what Commercial Enquiry would turn up when Jenny called him from the cellar.     "Have you seen all this stuff in the safe?"     For a moment his blood ran cold.  Then he realized that there was nothing there, but old catalogues.     "Yes," he called back, "Old catalogues from the Paris shop."  He wondered why she was poking about in there; he must have left it open.     "He had some interesting books for sale, but the mailing list is even more interesting, I'll bring it up." She came up the stairs clutching the file.     "How are the novels?" he asked.     "Most done, very good selection.  A couple are worth quite a lot, I'll need to phone round to confirm current values."  She put the file on the desk.  "Look at these."     Matthew opened the file and ran his eyes down the names - they were just names.     "Notice anything?" she said.     "They are listed by country?" he tried.     "No," try again.     Still rankled by the Nazi salute he was not in the mood for games.  "You tell me," he said.     "They are all Poste Restante, General Delivery, or a Box number, there isn't a single proper address."     Matthew looked again, she was right.  He hadn't noticed that the first time he'd seen the list.     "Odd, don't you think?" she looked like a detective who had found a killer red handed.     "Well?"  Grey shapeless suspiscions crowded at the edges of his mind pressing forward.  "What do you think it means?"     Jenny shrugged, "I don't know, but I think it’s very strange.  A whole mailing list and no real addresses."     He had to agree, it was odd.     "Any date on the list?" he asked.     "No, but I'd say it was pretty old. It was with the late forties catalogues."     "Perhaps they were refugees, or there were postal problems after the war?"  He was as unconvinced by his explanation as she was. "Well have you got a better explanation?" he said finally.     She shook her head.     Now they had another mystery.     "These are unusual too," she dropped another sheet of paper on the desk.     Book titles, all handwritten in German.     He looked up at her beginning to wish he'd shut the safe door.  He had enough questions to answer without more.     "They are synagogue books," she said.  "Hebrew religious texts, histories, commentaries, cabalah.   All of them earlier than 1800 and all of them quite valuable from what little I know about them."     He looked at the writing.     "That's not Maurice's handwriting," she said, "I'm very familiar with it by now and that is definitely German school taught script."     The grey suspiscions crowded closer.     "I could make some enquiries about them?"     He nodded, not really listening.  He didn't like what he was thinking.  Jenny picked up the sheet.  "Lunch time," she said.     "Hmm?" said Matthew.     "Lunch time."     "Yes, right," Matthew stood up, he may have had an answer to the account enquiry by now.     "I've some shopping to do first," said Jenny.     "Come upstairs if you want when you get back," said Matthew.     "Thanks," she took her coat from the corner, "Will you lock up?"     The message indicator light blinked at him and he pressed the play button.     “This is in answer to your request of this morning.”  There was a pause, discrete, thought Matthew.     ”The originating account number is 74659686 in the name you gave us.  The sum was transfered to that account from a bank in Angoulime, XXX district, France.  The depositer was M. Michel Serrault.  The current sum in account number 74659686 is 330 FF.”     The message ended.     So that cost me £250, thought Matthew, and it's Angoulime again.  So every year, well, for the last five to my knowledge, someone has deposited 20,000FF in a French account in Maurice's favour, which has then been transfered to the London bank.  Why?  It works out at, say ten francs to the pound at about fourty pounds a week.  Hardly a fortune, though certainly useful, but what was it for?  And who is this M. Serrault?     To these questions Matthew had no answers and no ideas.  He replayed the message, made notes in the file, and then wiped the tape.     He lit the gas under the percolator; may as well reheat what was left.       He'd have a look for an attic access and another general search in case he had overlooked any old bank statements.  It would be interesting to know how far back those payments went.  He could probably find out for another £250, but it wasn't yet that pressing a question.     He made a cheese sandwich, he was feeling hungry.     The phone rang.  It was Jenny.  She sounded breathless.     "Matthew, I've had an idea.  I'm going to check it out. I could be a bit late back.  Is that okay?     "Yes," he said.  Before he could ask her what it was, she'd hung up.  She's really getting in to this, he thought.  But he had to admit, he couldn't manage without her.  There was the shop, apart from the journals.  He also had to admit he quite liked her - she was fun, in her serious sort of way.     He turned on the TV, but he had missed the news. He watched fifteen minutes of a wild life programme without concentration.  The Camden Journal would be out tomorrow, that would have the latest on the Julien murders.  It was possible that they were unconnected, but their timing argued strongly for a connection with his call.  That worried him. Not that he believed that the police would think him a suspect - he had been in the shop all afternoon with Jenny. However, he would prefer not to be questioned, especially about the books.     "But they can't trace them to me."       Could you get finger prints from paper?  He had touched the covers and some of the pages.  Not good.     More worrying was the thought that someone, Willi  (Had he really returned to Amsterdam?)  was watching him. Why?  Did they suspect that he was finding things out about Maurice that they would prefer unfound?     Marion said Willi worked for her uncle, who wanted the Chasseur.  How did they know he had it and would sell it?  They didn't know until after the Julien's had been killed,  assuming of course they had been killed for the Chasseur which someone thought he may have sold to them.     So why was the Chasseur so important?  And who was this someone if it wasn't Willi?     Matthew turned off the TV and the fire, and he went back down to the shop.     He sat staring at the shelves.       What if Maurice had sold looted books and helped a German to escape to the West when the Third Reich had reaped its nemesis?     Lots of looted art had gone west, too, and to the east.  Some had returned to owners or their families if they could prove provenance.  The USA and West Germany had a good record as far as that was concerned.  But what of the rest?  Some, perhaps most, had come onto the open market after the war. And Maurice?  If he had known the owners still lived, (though how could he?) what guilt was being condoned or condemned here?  Moral blindness?     Matthew stood up and walked round the shelves.  Were all these books clean?  He stopped in front of Politics and Eugenics and pulled out a copy of Haffstadter's Geopolitics, 1930 edition, English translation, good condition.  He put it back.     Didn't friendship transcend politics?  Had Ernst chosen which side to be born on any more than Maurice had?  Few Germans had opposed Hitler before 1939, few could once the war had begun.  There weren't many Bonnhoffers or Niermollers in this world.     The shop bell rang and Jack Dobson came in.     "How's business?" he asked.     "Slow," said Matthew. "You?"     "Business, what business?" They both laughed a little.     "Thanks for the trays," said Matthew and went to the desk and took out a replacement bottle of Malt still in its box.  Handing it to Jack he said, "Thanks for everything."     He could see Jack was pleased.     "Pull up a chair.  Tea?"  Matthew put on the kettle.     "Where's young Jenny? asked Jack.     "Shopping," said Matthew.     "Nasty business, that murder," said Jack suddenly.     "They were at the funeral," Matthew didn't turn round as he dropped the tea bags into the cups.     "Don't know why.  Maurice couldn't stand the man."  Jack stretched out his legs.     Matthew watered and milked the cups and brought them over.     "Jack, can I ask you  something?"     "Fire away, as long as it's not for money."     "Was Maurice," he hesitated seeing the immediate look on Jack's face, "Right wing - I mean very right wing?"     Matthew could swear Jack looked relieved.     He nodded, "Yes, you could say that," he said.     "Did he talk much about it?"     "No, not in later years."     "Earlier?"     "We argued.  I was more to the left then; a bit of a red.  No, a lot of a red in those days."  He smiled. "Age usually softens the vigorous opinions of youth, black and white, or red in my case, becomes more grey."     "Would you say he was a Nazi?"     "Thatcher and half the Tories in government could be so described, by some people," there was a twinkle in his eye, "as Nazis.  The whole bloody country's gone to the right, if you ask me."  He looked serious for a moment.  "It wouldn't surprise me if the National Front didn't end up in the Tory Party with the way things are going."     Matthew told him about the couple who had come in that morning and about the salute.     "Getting fashionable again," he said.  "In the twenties and thirties it was the left, now it’s the right.  It all depends on how you view life.  As a struggle or as cooperation."     "The classless society is a long way off," said Matthew.     "Don't I know it," said Jack with feeling.  "Left or right, all government is about power, and power corrupts - some more than others."     "What about Genocide?"     "As practised by Hitler, or Stalin or the Europeans against the Amerindians or the British against the Australian Aboriginals, or the Israelis against the Palestinians, or half the black Africans against the other half?     "You sound cynical," said Matthew,     "Last refuge of a scoundrel," said Jack finishing his tea. "Well, I must be off."  He waved the bottle at Matthew.  "I appreciate it, son.  He stopped half way down the shop.  "Your father was sincere in his beliefs, he was no rabid thug.  I didn't agree with him, but I respected him.  That's what democracy's about - respect, tolerance and discussion."     And he left leaving Matthew to wrestle with his ever growing band of doubts, ghosts and shadows.     A motorcycle courier came through the door almost without opening it, a package in one gloved hand and his half removed helmet in the other.     "Sign this mate," he shoved a tatty book in front of Matthew.     "Thanks," and he was gone, the door banging behind him and the bike roaring away like the start to a TT race.     Matthew undid the package.  An invoice for £25 from the bank for the  Photostat and Urgent Delivery.  Already debited from his account he noticed.  He drew out the photostat.  There on the bottom by the number 32 was a small diamond circled by a snake.     "Pretty conclusive," said Matthew to himself, "It's Zollman's book."     Morality had come home to roost.  Should he give it back or take the offered £1000?     He looked at the sheet.  Where did he stand politically as a nice, tolerant, liberal-socialist living in a moderately affluent democracy with both choice and leisure?  How would he feel if he were one of the long-term unemployed or a persecuted minority?  Where would he have stood in 1930's Germany or in Post-revolutionary Russia?  Would he have had much choice then?  It was all very well to vote Labour and to feel outraged at Thatcherism, but he knew in his heart that he had not yet been tested.     When Jenny returned just before three, her face was alive with the joy of success in her discoveries.     "Sorry," she said, "It took longer than I thought, but I think you'll find it more than interesting."  She dumped her coat and sat at the desk with a large brown envelope in front of her.     "I went to the Jewish Library in Endsleigh Place.  took a bit of persuasion to get them to let me in without an appointment." As she talked she drew out half a dozen sheets of paper.  "The place is like Fort Knox.  Now this is the list of books I found in the safe.  And this," she placed a photocopy of a page from a book next to it, "is a list of books once held in the Rabbinical Library at the Old Synagogue in Szczecin, Poland."     Matthew looked from one list to the other.     "They are not in the same order, and some on this list," she pointed to the photocopy, "aren't on the handwritten list.  But, the majority are."     "What exactly are you saying?" said Matthew.     "That, and this is according to the librarian, the handwritten list is probably a record of books taken from the synagogue.  I let him have a copy of the handwritten list so he could try to trace some of the other books on it."     She sat back looking very pleased with herself.     For some reason Matthew could not immediately fathom he was angry with her.  She should have told him what she intended to do.     "We don't have any of these books," he said finally.     "I know we don't, but Maurice might have once.  I'm going to check through some of those early catalogues to see if they were ever offered for sale."      Matthew now knew the source of his anger.  He was afraid that they would be there and that they would next discover that Maurice had known of their tainted origin.     "There's something here, too," she pulled out the other sheets.  "These are summaries of 'Alter Cammeraden' escape routes.  As you can see, very little is known.  This book only came out in '86.  Produced by the Wiesenthal Foundation, it lists wanted Nazis, how they escaped, and what is known about them.     "Yes," said Matthew.  He read about these 'routes' before.  Most of it was factually dubious to say the least, being based more on surmise and hearsay than on hard evidence.     "Look at this one," said Jenny pointing half way down the third page.     "One such route went via Paris until 1949 and assisted Nazis to find havens in the Middle East and South Africa."  He looked up at her.     "Maurice was in Paris in 1948 - there's a date on one of the catalogues - and Ernst Todt is in South Africa."     "Are you suggesting Maurice was involved in smuggling Nazis out of Germany?" said Matthew coldly.     "Well he could have been," she said.     "These men were…"  Matthew began.     "Soldiers," she said vehemently.     "Rape, pillage, looting, genocide." his voice rising.     "Over fifty years ago!  Long before you, or I were born."     "So time becomes an excuse?"     Jenny was silent.     "They weren't all like that," she said finally.     "No, true," he had to agree, "They weren't."     "Do you think it's fair to hunt men down over half a century later to face show trials in Israel because they obeyed orders?"  Look at Israel, how about their record of Civil Rights to the Palestinians now."  Her face was set with suppressed anger,     "Concentration Camps," said Matthew quietly.     Jenny looked at him, "You're an historian, you know about the British Camps and the Boer women."     "Very different.  That wasn't a policy of Endlossen," he said.     "Wasn't it?"  Her voice rose, "What's wrong with wanting your own culture in your own Country?"     "Nothing," said Matthew.  "But the less than one percent Jews in the total German population was hardly a threat to German culture.   They were Germans themselves."     Jenny wasn't listening.  Her eyes were shut and her face was screwing up.  A tear ran from her right eye.     Matthew stood up and put an arm round her shoulders.     "I'm sorry," he said. "He was my father."     "And you want him to be moral and pure, " she said her voice breaking.  "You didn't mind him being homosexual but you'll condemn his beliefs."     Matthew stroked her hair.  She was right, he could accept that.  In a way it even gave him a frisson of excitement.     Jenny turned her head into his chest, her tears wetting his shirt.  Slowly her soft crying stopped, but she did not move away and he left his arm round her shoulders.     "Do you want to wash your face," he said eventually, unsure of their position.     "Yes, please," she said.     "Do you want to use the flat?"     She nodded, her head still against him.     "Come on then," he spoke gently.     She stood up, her face red her eyes unaturally bright.  "I'm sorry," she said.     "That's okay.  You go up.  I've had enough for today; I'll close early."          She still had not come down by the time he had tidied and locked the front door.  He collected her papers and coat and his package, and locked the connecting door and went upstairs.     Jenny had tidied herself up and was looking much better.  She had taken off her cardigan and was sitting by the fire.  Her tee shirt was tucked into the top of her skirt which she had drawn up to her knees.     "I love a gas fire," she said.  "They are so warm and friendly.  I've made a cup of tea, it's brewing," she added.     Matthew put her coat and the papers on the table.  He went to turn on the light.     "It's much nicer without it," she said.     He left the light and pouring the tea brought it into the living room putting the cups down by the grate.     "Thank you," she said and lent towards him putting her hand on his arm.  Her still bright eyes searched his face.     He moved nearer, precarious on the edge of his seat, their faces now inches apart.     "I'm sorry," she said moving back slightly.     "For what?"  He, too, moved back a little.     "Everything."     "Everything?  I don't understand."     "Your father, the books."  There was a pause, "Things with your wife."     "Why should you be sorry?  You're being a great help."     "I," she looked down and her voice went husky, "I want to help all I can."      Matthew felt a tightening in his stomach.      "You are helping.  I can't read the German."      Her fingers moved gently along his arm.      "You seem so lonely, like he did."      Matthew put his hand over hers and then drew it between them.  Her other hand joined with his and they sat, facing apart, linked.  Hands joined between near touching knees.  He moved his head towards hers.  She did not move away.  He dropped their joined hands pulling her into him.  She did not resist the kiss, soft at first, as if only a brushing friendship.  They kissed again and he felt his own desire mounting.  He broke his hands away and placed them on her shoulders.  She slipped from the chair, her body now between his legs, her face against his chest.  They stayed close for a long time with no words.       "Jenny."  His mouth was dry and the name came out as a dry sob.       "It's alright," she whispered the words against his shirt.        Matthew bent his head and breathed in the scent of her hair, his arms about her back.        "It's alright," she said again. "I know, I understand."        He moved his hands on her back, pulling the Tee shirt free of the skirt.  He caressed her skin, found the strap to her brassier, and undid it.  She made no move away.  He bent to her neck, his lips brushed her ear.         "I want you," he whispered.         "I know," her voice was steady.          He slipped down onto his knees beside her. They lay out side by side in front of the fire.  He moved himself over her.  They lay together for a while neither moving.  Finally, Matthew raised himself and undid the buttons of her blouse brushing away the material and uncovering her breasts.  He laid his face to them while she softly caressed his hair with her hands.  Little by little he drew up her skirt and balancing himself on his elbows he released his belt easing down his trousers.  Jenny neither resisted nor encouraged as he continued their undressing.  Finally he was naked against her and she against him, but not open to him.         "Do what you want," she said, her arms about him, her body unmoving.         Relief came almost mechanically, embarrassingly.  She sat up wiping herself and reassuring him with gentle words.            They dressed hurridly.           "The tea's cold."   She stood up, "I'll make another pot and then I must go home."           It was as if nothing had happened.                January 8th. 1989	            Morning came, indistinct at first, like a slow remembering, or the silent clearing of a dawn fog.  Matthew lay still, replete in mind and body, awake, yet in an unreal world where the memory of last night washed over him and stirred desire again.  He turned and remembered he was alone.  Memory hardened, sharpened and then gave way before a sudden wave of embarrassment.  In just over an hour he would face her again.  But this time clothed, in the shop and in daylight.  How would he greet her?  Why had she not stayed?  He sat up and threw back the duvet.  He shivered in the cold of the room and quickly pulled his dressing gown toward him covering the nakedness she had seen.       	He went to the bathroom.  It was not the nakedness, nor what they had done.  His marriage was over, the divorce had begun. The hot water crashed against him, "Do what you want", she had said, yet she had done nothing.  All that had been, had been his doing.	He towelled himself dry.  Angry, for despite his thoughts he wanted her again, he dressed quickly.  He tried not to think of her.  There would be a next time.  He pushed the images back.  This time he would...he half slipped on the steep stairs down to the kitchen.	`Make coffee and feed the cat, he said clearly to himself clicking on the kitchen light.  `We are both adults and did what we wanted to do.  Despite his words he was still uneasy when he knew he should not have been.	He went down to the shop, ten minutes early by his watch.  Jenny was already there at the desk, the mail part opened in front of her.  He had not heard her come in.              “Morning Matthew,” she smiled up at him, “Mainly bills so far.”  She passed him a letter.  “This one is marked confidential, with a Cambridge postmark.”  She went back to the unopened letters.	Last night had never been.	Matthew went to the long table and ripped the letter from the envelope.  Dr. Lester did not believe in typewriters or wordprocessors, for the four pages of the letter were covered in his tidy and precise hand.   		“Dear Mr. Vigor,	I cannot tell you how important the papers are that you have so kindly given me to read.  The Simms experiments, so long a missing peice in the jigsaw of war time research…”		Matthew read quickly through the eulogy.  A paragraph caught his eye.		However, despite the quite understandable error in his calculations, his basic premise was correct.  Although he would have needed the output of a whole generating station to power the device.  I and my colleagues in the Department of Mathematics are unanimous in requesting that you consider donating these papers to the college.  The ‘Simms Anomaly’, as we are currently terming the equations he used, are themselves worthy of a paper.  While the whole package would, as the ‘Vigor Bequest’, be a fitting memorial to your father and the role he played in this research.’	Matthew placed the letter on the table and looked out of the window.  So far the little he had from his father’s past was wanted by everyone, yet they offered nothing in return.  Well, nothing apart from a ‘generous bequest’ placard in a college archive and a thousand pounds for the Chasseur.  Then there was Sue, if she heard of his inheritance she would be after half of it according to his solicitor.	His dour thoughts were interrupted by the consciousness of being watched.  Matthew concentrated on the street.  People passed.  Buses, cars, lorries and there, in the doorway of the old shoe shop, shadowed, but definitely there in raincoat and hat, a tall thin figure staring back at him.  Matthew stood up.  The door bell jangled as a customer entered and Matthew exited too late.  There was no one, just a litter strewn abandoned shopfront whose windows proclaimed posters past and present.  He looked up and down the street and suddenly self-conscious of his paranoia he crossed back into the shop.  Jenny had not looked up from her desk despite the bell that jangled his re-entry.  He went back to the long table and the letter.  He would let the college have the Simms papers and accept the bequest in his father’s name.  Of course that assumed that he would get probate and that he was the only offspring of Maurice Vigor and that Sue did not get at the ‘inheritance’.  He sat and looked out of the window seeing nothing.		“Matthew, Matthew!”	He looked up.	“A Mr. Zollman on the line.”	Jenny had the telephone at its longest extension and was waving it at him.	He stood up and went half way to meet her and the phone.	“Who?”	“Mr. Zollman.”	He took the phone and winding the cord back made his way over to the sink at the back of the shop.	“Hallo, this is Matthew Vigor.”  There was an accent, German?  No, Dutch.	“Mr. Vigor, you have met my niece.”	“Yes.”	“Then I am sure you know what I am calling about.”	“I have a good idea.”	“There is a diamond and a snake on page 32.”	Obviously, Zollman did not believe in questions.  	“Are you asking or telling?”  said Matthew striving to keep any hint of irritation from his tone.	“I would very much like to meet with you, Mr. Vigor.”	“I was under the impression that you did not travel.”  Two could play at this game.	“I do not.  However, I would like to invite you to Amsterdam.”	Matthew thought quickly, but not quick enough.	“You are not busy at the moment and a day or two would be quite long enough.”	“You appear to know a lot about me.”	“It is my business to know about some people.”	 “Are you having me watched?”	Matthew saw Jenny look up and then quickly back to the work on her desk.	“That would be an invasion of privacy, Mr. Vigor.”	‘Yes,” thought Matthew, “it would, but are you?”	“I will have tickets waiting for you at the City Airport, there is a flight at three this afternoon and a car will meet you at Schipol.”	“I do not have the book.”	“I know that.  I do, however, have something that might interest you.”	Before Matthew could reply the line clicked.	Matthew replaced the receiver and wondered why Jenny asked nothing.	“I’ll be back in a mo,” he said.  She nodded.		His passport was valid.  Did you still need one for the Common Market?  Take it anyway.  He had enough cash, that could be changed at the airport.  Few clothes in a suitcase and he could easily make the plane.  Suddenly he realised that he had not questioned going.  But then Zollman was right, he didn’t have anything else to do.  Jenny could manage without him and it, whatever the ‘something’ was that Zollman alluded to, may well interest him.		“I’m going to Amsterdam,” he said.	Jenny looked up and smiled.	“When will you be back?”	“Day or two.  Can you feed the cat?”	“No problem.”	Now there was the perfect wife, no questions, just yes dear.	“It’s about that damned Chasseur,” he voluntered. 	“Oh.  Shall I keep on with the translations?”	“If you don’t mind.”	“You know I don’t.”	This going-no-where conversation was interrupted by the shop bell and Matthew went back upstairs.  He could only handle so much crypticism in one day.		City Airport, apart from being impossible to get to except by cab, was about as busy as a turkey farm on Boxing Day.	He made his way to the first ticket desk.	“I...” he already felt embarrassed.”	“Yes sir?”  The smile had been trained to disarm.	“I’m going to Amsterdam, but I don’t know which airline the tickets were left with.”  He wondered if anyone could sound more stupid if they really tried. 	“Amsterdam flights from over there,” she pointed with a carefully manicured hand. “I’m sure they can help you.”		“I’ve tickets for the three o’clock flight,” he said.	Also manicured, she looked at her screen.	Perhaps there was little else to do here, he thought.	“Mr. Vigor, Matthew Vigor?”	He nodded.	She passed him tickets and a boarding pass.	“You may board in twenty minutes, if you wish to use the lounge until then.”  She smiled.	He nodded and looked in the direction she had indicated.	It said First Class Only in bold letters.  He looked at the tickets.  They were First Class.	He sank into upholstery that threatened to suffocate and accepted the complimentary glass of wine.	“I’ll call you when boarding begins,” the smile caressed him and left.	He looked round.  So far just him and a pile of international newspapers and the soft hum of the air conditioning which was a little optimistic for London.   		How did they make a profit?  They were in the air and levelling out.  Apart from two others in First Class, both busy with papers and laptops and bearing the unmistakable signs of well-fed importance, he had only seen about ten other people.  It may well be a small plane, but at least two-thirds of it had to be empty.	He accepted the proffered drink and nibbled at the hors d’oeuvres that sat temptingly beside him in the wide aisle.  He flipped at a magazine and then, aided by the wine, slipped into a half doze, his seat belt still comfortably fastened.  When it came to flying he didn’t like to take any chances.		“Landing in five minutes, sir,” she bent close to him checking the seat belt.  “Is there anything you need?”	He shook his head, but let the sudden lewd thoughts continue to take his mind of the decceleration and descent.		No one asked for his passport and he didn’t even see a Customs sign.  He did see the neat card with ‘Vigor’, block lettered in black on white.	He went over.		The Mercedes slid quickly through the traffic,soon leaving the main road, then weaving a route through narrow streets and over tight humped bridges that would have taxed Ariadne’s thread to retrace, and finally pulling up outside a tall thin canal-side hotel. 	“You will please stay here for the night and Hern Zollman will see you at ten in the morning.  I will come for you.”  The car pulled away even as Matthew clicked the heavy door shut.	He was expected and his room looked out over the canal.  He wondered if the ‘you will stay here for the night was a command?’	The room was simple, but comfortable with closet, chairs and a wide bed.  He smiled at the neat condom packet discretely placed by the phone.  Well, it made a change from the usual mint chocolate in a silver wrapper. He didn’t bother to unpack; it was easier to just use the suitcase.  It was now just after five.  A walk, a meal, and an early night.  A map of the city, currently more use than the hotel notepaper, lay on the small desk together with the brochures and flyers extolling museums and canal trips.  Matthew spread it out on the bed.  The hotel appeared by the address to be just off Dam Square.  He orientated the map.  Out the door, turn left and head toward the railway station.  That meant that the Red Light district was just off to the right.  Funny how you remembered things read years ago.  Well it was too late for museums and canal trips so what else was there to do?  There were supposed to be some reasonable cafes in the area, too.  Not that he intended more than a walk, but you couldn’t come to Amsterdam and not visit the naughty areas could you?  He smiled at his self justification, what the hell?  May as well go for an interesting walk.	“Hern Vigor.”	He turned, the clerk was smiling at him.	“You are going out?”	“A short walk and a meal.”	“Ah so, there is a good cafe at the end of the street by the canal bridge.”	“Thank you,” Matthew turned back to the door.	“Good appetite,” said the clerk and Matthew heard him pick up the phone.		The Square was crowded and the evening warm with that unmistakable continental feel to it that London never had.  He felt liberated and a frisson of excitement coursed through his body.  	‘This is better than teaching anyday,’ he thought and he crossed the road toward the small streets that ran off at right angles.  He chose the widest that followed the course of a canal and slowed his pace to an easy amble.  The crowds thinned and the tall houses threw shadows half way up their brethren opposite which made the lighted windows all the brighter.  More listless than inviting the window-framed girls soon lost the lure of novelty and Matthew quickened his pace.  Over the next bridge a noisy cafe beckoned and he took a seat just inside the door.  Mountains of chocolated cake and sweet biscuits teetered on plates crammed together on the counter.  To the left of them in a glass display sat neat and tiny cubes of hash.  From golden brown to the deepest oily black they proclaimed the liberality and good sense of the legislating burghers of the Estates General and their presence brought a smile to Matthew’s face that proclaimed him a visitor.	He ordered thick pea soup and dark bread.  He would also have the pork and cabbage and a large coffee.	The waiter waited, then sensing that was really all, carried off the order to the kitchen. 	The food was plentiful, enjoyable and expensive.	Matthew savoured the coffee.  He debated the hash, then decided against it.  It was still early.  He ordered another coffee and a small cognac to go with it.	“It is free?”	Matthew looked up.	“Yes,” he said.	The man, about forty, light build wearing a dark suit and a hat sat down and placed his hat on the end of the table.  He brushed back a matted strand of his black straight hair which had fallen over his forehead and then steepled his fingers in front of him.	“How are you liking our city?”	Before Matthew could answer the waiter arrived and the man ordered in fast brutal Dutch and then turned back to Matthew.	“I knew you were English - there are many here.  You get to know all the nationalities.”	“I’ve only just arrived,” said Matthew.	“You will stay long?”	“A day or so, business.”	“Ah.  Then you will not get to see so much.  Perhaps you will come back?”	“Perhaps,” said Matthew.	“There is a lot to see here.  It is a fascinating place, especially for those with tastes.”  The man waved his hand generally and resteepled it.  His eyes so black Matthew could not see the pupils, nor tell exactly what lay behind the words.	A coffee arrived accompanied by a wedge of chocolate cake.	“Do you mind?”	The man opened a silver cigarette case and took out a neatly rolled joint.	“I prefer my own, not that what is here is not very good.”	He lit the end with a lighter that matched the case.	“I see you have not tried the house speciality.” 		He pointed at the cognac.	“That is good, but it does not, er, enhance the appetite in quite the same way.  But perhaps you do not like to smoke alone?”	The joint smelt very strong.	“Let me share a little of mine with you, Dutch hospitality.”	He called something to the waiter over his shoulder and passed the joint to Matthew.	Somehow Matthew felt he didn’t have a lot of choice.  He took the proffered joint and drew gently on it.  The smoke was sweet and he hardly coughed at all.	“Thank you,” he said.	“No, please, have a little more.”	The man began to fork small pieces of cake into his mouth and to sip at the coffee in obvious enjoyment.  Matthew kept the joint.  A piece of chocolate cake with fork arrived in front of him.	“My treat,” said the man.	“So, what business are you in?”	“Books,” said Matthew.	“Food of the mind,” and the man laughed without humour.	“Old books,” said Matthew and placed the joint on the edge of the ash tray.  He could feel his body and the sounds of the cafe were merging, then separating into discrete conversations and then merging again.	“There are many old things in Amsterdam, buildings, books, people.”	The cake tasted very good.	“And they all have stories to tell,” he paused and then looked straight at Matthew, “But not all the stories are to be believed.”	He took the joint from the edge of the ashtray and relit it		“There is good and bad in every city, wouldn’t you say?”	“Yes,” said Matthew uncertainly.	“What would you say was bad in London?”	The question caught him unawares.	“Dirt, graffetti,” he paused thinking of the littered homeless, the urined doorways, the semi-derelict estates in the north and east.	“It is the same in most of our cities,” The man spoke as if he had been reading Matthew’s mind.  “And do you know why?  Immigrants, non-Europeans crowding in like rats.”	He finished his coffee and stood up.	“Enjoy your cake, enjoy Amsterdam.”	He picked up his hat and with the hint of a half-wink he was gone.	Matthew toyed with the last piece of cake as a sense of unease took hold of him.  Had he missed a warning somewhere?  Or a message?  Or was this just cafe talk?  The remains of the crushed joint smouldered sourly in the ashtray.  He pushed it aside.  May as well wander a bit and then go back to the hotel.  He stood up.  The waiter was by his side, bill in hand. The soup, the pork, two coffees and two chocolate cakes.  He’d been taken and at these prices he did not find it at all funny. 	 He made his way straight back to the hotel, ignored the clerk’s greeting and slammed his room door shut. Immediately regretting his petty display of temper he felt his frustration mount.  He kicked his shoes off and turned on the T.V. The condom in its silver wrapper was on the floor.  He looked, the window was closed.  It hadn’t been on the floor when he had left and he didn’t remember knocking against the small table or even going over there. Had someone been in the room?  Paranoia swept over him. He checked his case.  He could see nothing unusual.  He went round the room.  Again nothing. The remnants of the smoke and the cake cloyed in his mouth.  He went into the bathroom and cleaned his teeth.	“Of course!”  Relief flooded through him.  When he had slammed the door, that’s what did it, the sudden draught in the room.	He returned to the bedroom and flicked through the channels.  The news in Dutch did little for him.  Neither did an old episode of East Enders with sub titles.  Two porn channels so obvious and banal that they showed no break in action when he flicked from one to the other. 	“Enough.  Bed, shower in the morning and wait for the car from Zollman.”	He pulled off his clothes and killed the light and the T.V.  	The room was part lit by a light from somewhere, but he couldn’t be bothered to trace it.  He knew he would sleep, but what dreams would sleep bring?	 		 	 		January to April 1945.	As Maurice finished his second attempt at a letter to Jane and Mrs. Simms, he realised what day it was. The first of January 1945.  Whatever celebrations the hotel had seen the night before he had slept through.  Looking round he saw no evidence of any partying, but then the push was on again and the hotel's population appeared to be far less than it had been only a couple of days ago.            Despite everything that Eric had said and done, Maurice missed him.  'Yes', said some voice deep inside 'so you miss him, and you were at risk from him; now you are not.'  He could not argue with that truth, nor for the present could he persuade the guilt he felt of its error.     How often he had replayed the moment of Eric's death. Now even in this short while, so overlaid with 'did I's' and 'could I's', he could no longer trust the recollection.  There was only his memory, and if he could not be sure of it, then what defence would he ever have against the guilt he felt?  	'None.'  said  guilt, and he felt it dig deeper.	'But you are free.'  Said relief, another voice; joining the inner dialogue, ‘remember that.  See, your fears have gone, you are safe.'	He pressed his hands to his ears, but still he heard the voices arguing like tiresome lawyers before a deaf struck judge.  	Relief and guilt battled for his sole acceptance until he numbed them both refusing either access to his conscious mind.  There had been an accident, his companion had been killed, now he must wait for a replacement and then continue the job he been sent out here to do.  With the enemy falling back, more and more factories would need inspection, more and more reports would have to be written; he would be busy, very busy.	But for the moment he was not busy.  He felt the turmoil and he heard their pleading like a wind swelling the  sea before the storm.	"Monsieur."  He looked up, it was the maid.  "Il y a un jeune homme pour vous, dehors."	Maurice asked for him to be brought in.  It was the dark-eyed kitten from the Rue Nagy.  He looked at him without expression.	"Please, I have something for you."  He was holding out Eric's bag; it appeared quite heavy.  	Maurice made no move.  The bag slowly dragged itself down to the floor. 	"You are Monsieur Vigor?"  The youth did not understand.	"Yes."  said Maurice.	"He is dead, Monsieur Simms."  He had tears in his eyes.	"Yes."  Said Maurice who felt nothing.	Still not understanding, the youth pushed the bag towards Maurice.  "His things are for you."	"Thank you."  said Maurice politely.	"I gave him a present, it was all I had."  It was obvious that he wanted money and he knew he was obvious.  He was also afraid of this cold Englishman who should have liked him.	"Ah."  said Maurice and he slowly took out his wallet and counted some francs openly onto the table.  "Take them."	The youth put out his hand and as he did Maurice grabbed his wrist, twisted a little,  and pulled him down to him. 	"Did you steal anything?"  he asked quietly, his tone neutral, dispassionate.	The youth was now very afraid.  He had met cold men like this before and he knew what they liked to do.  He pleaded innocence.  Maurice twisted a little more and watched the pain course across the pretty face.  	"What is your name?"	"Pierre Lapointe, monsieur."  The voice quivered.	Maurice let go. The youth moved slowly, uncertain.  His hand stayed near the money, but his eyes were on Maurice.	"Get out."  said Maurice and he nodded at the money.	Taking it, the youth fled.  Maurice lent back.  There was no feeling, no flicker of anything.  In the past he would have wanted that body, he would have wanted...now not even the thought was worth thinking.  He picked up the bag and went to his room with the two beds.	He tipped out the bag. A heavy leather bound book fell onto the bed.  He just caught it before its momentum carried it to the floor.	"Chasseur D'Amour," he opened it, "Reims, 1630. Very good condition, very good, but hardly your reading, Eric. I wonder where you stole this from, Lapointe."  It was certain that was the only way he could have obtained it.	He looked briefly over the rest of the scattered contents, then swept them back into the bag and threw it into the corner. He took the book over to his bed and put it on the small table; he would look at it later.	He went back down stairs.  The adjutant was in the small room he had recently taken over as his office. Maurice gave him the Brighton letter.	"No problem, old chap.  It'll go out with this stuff."  He pointed to a pile of files, papers, and envelopes stacked on the end of his desk."	Maurice asked how long he thought he may have to wait to hear what he was to do next.	"No idea, never had a seconded civilian before.  Could be a week or so.  Just rest.  I should think you could do with it."	Maurice would have far preferred to be away from the town and working, but he smiled and nodded.  Luckily, the adjutant was no great conversationalist, and besides, he did have work to do.  Maurice wandered off into the town; he may as well explore as do anything.	In the oldest quarter that lay between the great Catholic church and the bend in the river by the bridge, he found a bookshop.  It was open, full of books and had that undefinable smell of leather, paper, must and magic that is irresistable to those of a bibliophilic nature.	"Come in and browse, dear sir."  he was welcomed by the proprietor.  "There is no rush.  Take your time, read if you wish."  He pointed to a long table in the far corner of the shop by the window that had four seats along its side.	Maurice looked round, apart from the old man he was the only other person in the shop.  His surveillance was noticed.	"War is not a good time for books."  He laughed a little thin dry laugh, "Or people."	"No." said Maurice.	"English?"  	"Yes, I am."	"German officers are better for books than the English."	Maurice raised his eyebrows.  "Perhaps that is because the English gentry who become officers prefer horses to education."	Again the thin dry laugh, "You I think, do not prefer horses."	"I am not gentry.” 	"Nor an officer?"  It could almost have been a statement.	"Nor an officer."  Maurice agreed.	"Then you are most welcome."  	"Thank you." said Maurice as he went over to a shelf chosen purely for the bindings he could see, closer they revealed themselves as 'Topography and Travel'.	"Before the war the English used to come here.  The church is fourteenth century. There was a famous nunnery.  It is said that it was a place of visions."  	Maurice nodded, but did not turn round.	"Do you have any special interests?"  The old man had put just sufficient emphasis on the word special for Maurice to know exactly what he meant.	Maurice turned and looked at him.  He must have been nearly seventy, white haired with a sallow complexion that comes from avoiding the sun.  The eyes were yellow hazel and set deep into the lined face.  The body was thin like the laugh and slightly bent.  The dark suit hung on a frame that once had filled it. But the hands - the hands were large, the palms broad and the fingers long yet delicate, not weak, strong, but not brutish in their strength.  	"No, I have no special interests."  said Maurice with the same emphasis and momentary pause after the word 'no'.	The old man smiled at him.	"Once I had old books for the English taste, with illustrations, fine engravings by Tiderot,  Mille, even some after the style of Hogarth."  He shook his head sadly, "But no longer.  Now it is all Oriental."	Maurice was not sure what to say to this encomium.  He pulled down a volume, The Hartz Mountains. He thought of Ernst and his grandfather's estate.  He took the book to the table and sat down.  As he looked at the plates and skip read the text his mind fell into a reverie of remembrancing.  	"Will you eat lunch with me?"  The question was spoken in German.	"Thank you, yes."  replied Maurice in the same language realising he was hungry.	The woodman had his bag open, it was past noon and hot. Maurice and Ernst dismounted.     The chair scraped as the old man moved it aside spreading a small blue check cloth on the table.  Maurice's mind spun back.  Time and place shuddered and he left the photograph on the page and was again in the bookshop.  Wine, bread, and some cheese came to the table.  The old man sat beside him, poured a glass of wine for each of them  and bit with relish into a tiny onion he had hidden in his hand.	"You were there a long time?"  he said when he had finished chewing, this time in French.	"I'm sorry?"  Maurice was still re-orientating.	"You have looked at the picture for two hours.  They are good memories?"	"Yes, they are very good memories."	"The best memories are when we are young."  He finished the onion.  "When we get older there is more to remember, but the quality declines.  Luckily it is these we forget first."  The thin laugh came and went.  "But you are still young now."	"No."  said Maurice.  He took a piece of cheese and sipped the wine, it was dry and very soft.  "I am not young now."	"War ages men, or keeps them young forever.  I have seen it."  He drank his glass and refilled it.  "I was born during the Franco-Prussian war, too young for that."  The laugh flittered.  "To old for the Great War, far too old for this one."	Maurice said nothing.	"Where did you stay in the mountains?"	"Near Rinteln at first and then at the Carlsdorf estate."	The gentle easy questions continued and Maurice spoke about his time with Ernst and a little about his life in Leytonstone. 	"And then the war."  	Maurice nodded and folded the cloth as the old man took the remains of their meal away.  He came back and sat down again.	"War changes many things, but it is part of God's creation, if one is to believe Helmot von Moltke."	"If one is to believe God."  countered Maurice.  Talking to the old man was cathartic; he was feeling less fragmented.	"I was in Berlin in 1902 and I did not leave until 1911."  He spread out his great hands, "I was a piano player for clubs, dance halls, even once for a brothel."  	"Why did you leave?"  Maurice was curious.	"I was getting too old for the life, couldn't keep it up."  The thin laugh came for the private joke.  "But I would go back, even now, for the memories."	Maurice thinking of his own memories nodded absently in agreement. Then suddenly he remembered now.  "But..." He did not know how to ask this question, he was thinking of the occupation and of the undercurrents in the town. 	"It is too long ago for anyone to care."  The old man had seen his thoughts.	"Did you have friends then, in that war?"	"Before, during and after."  He folded up his hands  and looked at Maurice.  "Friendship is above everything.  It is everything.  Without it there is nothing.  How can you have loyalty to a high ideal if you have no loyalty to a person."  He was silent for a moment,” Fascism, Communism - they come, they go, friendship is forever."  He stood up.  "That is what you believe, too.  I can see it in your face."  He went back to his stool behind the counter by the door.	Maurice closed the book and stood up.  He would go for a walk.  He would also buy the book.	"To you, one franc, then you will come back."	Outside it was bright with a little wind.  It was not cold. He walked down to the river.  	He felt the book in his pocket. The old man was right, he would go back.  He felt well there among the books and the memories.  He stood on the river bank, swollen with rain and snow from further north and hurrying to the sea.  Maurice watched the heavy silted waters slide by with the occasional bush, tree branch and half submerged something turning in the eddies.  He was thinking about friendship, about Ernst and Eric and that the old man had expressed no political preference when dismissing ideologies.  Perhaps that wisdom came only with age, or with forced occupation.  It may only come when both have been tried and both found wanting and all that is left is religion or profound scepticism.	What must it be to grow old and have all your friends dead before you, to be alone?  To be truely alone?  Can family be friends? Maurice thought about this.  He had no brothers or sisters, no father either.  If he had, would they be friends?  They would not be chosen, they would be given.  One must be born loving one’s family - that would be natural. But would they be friends?  He didn't think so; they may become so, but not necessarily.  He loved his mother; she was not his friend.  He loved his grandparents because he had never thought about it and because they were his grandparents. They were not his friends.  He had loved Eric, because…Why had he loved Eric?  He thought of Eric's body, his need for someone to help him, a need Maurice fulfilled.  He thought of Eric's willingness and ability to please him.  A willingness alone to submit to the needs of another was not enough for love - there had to be something else.  The ability to please beyond need, that was it, perhaps.  Perhaps not.  He bent down picked up a stone and skimmed it across the river to the other bank.	He walked towards the bridge.  Was Eric my friend?  He had never asked this question before and he was not sure of the answer.  It was easy to say yes, because I loved him he was my friend; but like family this need not be true. Ernst was his friend and he loved him, but they were never lovers.  That was clear and easy.  Ernst was his friend and the love he had for him came from the friendship and would endure whatever.  The old man was right about that.	He reached the bridge and climbed to the roadway and walked to the middle of the central arch.  He lent over, the rushing curdled water was dizzying.	If Eric had been his friend and not just his lover would he have been so distrustful, so suspicious of his motives in wanting to help him in the work that he, Maurice, still did not fully understand?  Would he have betrayed his love with that kitten youth?  Perhaps. Does love allow betrayal? Can friendship allow betrayal?  He knew that the answer to that was absolute.  No.  Love can survive betrayal.  Friendship cannot.  He pressed himself against the bridge and thought of Pierre Lapointe.  If it had not been with him, it would have been with another.  Should he find Lapointe and fuck him?  Should he take him to the basement of the hotel and destroy him with sex?  Penetrate him so he choked to death as he came?  Tear him anally so badly he would exsanguinate, castrate him?  No, he would not, he had no interest in Pierre Lapointe.  He had no interest in anyone that way, now. Whatever Lapointe deserved he would get.  That much he trusted to the town of Angoulime.      	The next morning he was at the shop by nine.  The old man showed no surprise in seeing him.  Maurice browsed. He would take the odd volume to the table and read, then replace it. Some books he put to one side; these he intended to buy later.  Always the old man talked, about his life, about his books, and occasionally about the town.  They would lunch together on the blue checkered cloth spread over the table.  The open sign stayed on the door, but no one ever came in.	As the days passed Maurice began to ask about books and he was answered. Slowly he came to know their arcane secrets.  He would bring cheese or meat from the hotel, and American coffee courtesy of the adjutant.  He was repaid in knowledge.  Books on books were brought to the table.  He had days on printers, days on bindings, days on private collections.  Carefully and with constant testing the old man passed to Maurice all he knew about the world of antiquarian books.	This was just what Maurice had needed, a mind flooding task, to blot out the voices that tried to twist him into their insanity with their irresolvable accusations.  The more he refused to listen and the harder he worked, the weaker they became.	In the middle of the third week just as he was leaving for the bookshop the adjutant stuck his head out of the office.	"Got a minute, Maurice?"	He went in, the room was its usual chaos of files and papers.	"Orders for you, here somewhere."  He began to rummage.  "Came in early this morning so they can't be far."	Maurice waited.  Three weeks ago he wanted to leave, to go as far away as possible.  Now he wanted to stay, to be with the books and with the old man who had become his only friend in this empty and broken world.	"Got 'em."  triumph for the adjutant.  He held them aloft, then passed them to Maurice.  "Sit here if you want to go through them."  He dug another chair out from under the avalanche of bumph.  For a moment Maurice thought of Fran and Horace with a tinge of affection.  He tore open the envelope and read the thin paper carefully.  He read it again, then passed it back to the adjutant.  	"Will you need an office?"	"No."  said Maurice, "I can manage upstairs as long as I don't have to share."	"No fear of that, the room's yours.  What will you need?"	"Just a typewriter, some stationary and use of the phone and a vehicle, I suppose."	"No problems there as far as I can see.  Do you want to drive or do you prefer a driver?" 	"Driver's fine."	"Good, then no problem.  Welcome to the hotel workers."  The adjutant grinned.  "Bit early for a tot, my shout this evening."  	Maurice nodded, took back his orders, slipped them into his pocket and went off to the bookshop.  Some days things really did go the way one would want them to.	The fine drizzle and the cold wind did not intrude on his satisfaction. He wondered who he had to thank for this break?  He was now the area coordinator.  It appeared that the great push was over, the tanks had crossed the Our river and were back in Germany. He was free to travel without risk of running into hostile forces by mistake.  That made him considerably happier.     It also appeared that there was a whole mass of specialist works in this corner of France. He was to collect reports from field visits, review them and send them on to England.  He would be expected to visit and assist the men in the field, to resolve any local difficulties and generally do many of the things he had done since joining Fenton Street.  He was profoundly grateful for his languages and for the puffing blue-eyed man who'd seen so far into him during that short walk in Whitehall.	Diverting from his route to the bookshop Maurice arrived at the bridge.  He held on to the parapet and exalted; this was, he thought, one of the most perfect moments of his life.  With that thought came the realisation that Eric had been dead for a month and that he still could feel no grief.  The feeling of relief had passed and guilt had gone quiet, lying low only emerging at times of weakness to point and accuse.  	Perhaps the grief he had suffered during the months after the August debacle in the lab had used up all the sorrow their relationship had been worth and there was no more left for the death.  Maurice turned and began to walk to the shop.  	"Did I ever really love Eric?"  He sighed softly as he asked the unanswerable question.   He felt sure that he had, once, but the love had died before Eric. 	Despite his hopes Maurice spent less than a month in the town and the surrounding area.  Promising the old man that he would return, he left the books he had bought with him; there would be little space for them in his pack.  In the bottom of Eric's case he had found the lab notebook and a series of diagrams stuck to the inner lining.  He had very nearly thrown the bag out, only something had made him check through it again.  He had felt it unlikely that Eric would have left them in the lab or even at the cottage, but he thought he may have had a safer place to deposit them.  It was now obvious that the only safe place, as far as Eric had been concerned, was with him where ever he went.	Unsure at first what to do with them, Maurice decided to wrap them in some protection; the adjutant had some old yellow oilskin that proved ideal.  He then bound them with wire and left them together with the books at the shop.  Should he not return for them within one year the old man was instructed to destroy the yellow package and resell the books.	"So you have no family who would want such things?"	Maurice had sadly agreed this was so.	"Then it is no wonder I see you sad sometimes."  And the old man meant this.  He, too, had no one left who could appreciate the shop and its books apart from their purely commercial value.	Leaving the hotel for the uncertainty of the unknown did not please Maurice who feared more towns like Lise.  However, he had to move on despite the rain crashing into the cobbles and leaking into the corner of the car that came for him.  Not, he thought, a good start.  By the time his files and boxes were loaded and the driver had got the destination clear with the new adjutant, Maurice was far from a good mood. 	With the failure of Von Runstedt's attempted push to Antwerp, and Zukov's steady move westward, Germany was now being crushed by the twin pincers of the Allies.  Ruthlessly bombed to rubble, the blackened fires-stormed towns were a shameful testimony to Goering's failures and Anglo-American intent.  Speer organised to the hilt the last possibilities of the Reich's industrial output.  V2's struck out at long range, the Volksturm and its fanatic offspring snapped at the invader's heels.  But, the war was lost.  In an orgy of fratricide, the July plot and the great Africa Corps Fieldmarshall's involvement still burning in their memories, the black uniformed acolytes of the Himmlerian nightmare slaughtered any unwilling to partake of the Gotterdammerung.  	Into this ripped and shattered land Maurice followed the victorious army.  The factories of occupied France had yielded their meagre harvest of secrets; the West hungered for more.  He and his fellow weasels sought them out with their own army of scientists and civil servants as they probed into the bowels of the very Reich itself.	In these proper and efficient Hitlerian factories, Maurice was to meet pride, but also relief that it was at last over. However, the greatest relief was that they had fallen to the West and not to the raping and slaughtering Russian who had so many dead to avenge.	The weather had not improved throughout the whole day and the journey grew more and more depressing.  Lunching on cold rations from a jagged tin contributed little apart from necessary sustenance.  Life at the hotel had made Maurice expect more.  By evening they had arrived at the military HQ that was to be his new stepping off point. The first person he saw there was Michael Julian who had left the hotel about a week earlier.      "Maurice!"  Julien had seen him, too, and was coming over, "What brings  you  to  this  particular benighted spot in the Fatherland?"   	"Factories as usual."  replied Maurice in two minds about finding Julien here.  "What brings you?"	Julien came close, he'd begun his day's ration of alcohol, "Nazis, old boy. Nazis leaving the sinking ship."  He put his arm on Maurice's shoulder, "Come and have a welcome drink."	Maurice politely disengaged the arm, "Later, thanks. I'd better let someone know I'm here and find my digs."	"As you wish."  said Julien returning to the mess and pointing very deliberately to the sign as he passed through the door.	Maurice was not surprised to discover that no one knew who he was, why he was here, or what he was supposed to do.  Papers were looked at, phone calls made, and digs found.  It was quite easy once you knew what to say to whom and Maurice was learning.  If he needed office space he could share with a very busy supply officer; both men hoped such would not be necessary.  	From the papers he had brought with him he was able, after borrowing a phone for an hour, to arrange a schedule of visits to the other Inspectors in the area and to see some of the factories for himself.  Sometimes, he thought, the generalist sees more than the specialist if he keeps his eyes and ears open.  	So the pattern of visits and reports began to repeat itself. Now and again something of interest would emerge, but on the whole there was nothing spectacular.  Certainly he saw nothing of the whispered wonder weapons that were supposed to have saved the day for Hitler.  Perhaps they were all in Berlin; if so, they had better be used now for the Russians were at the gates and the Anglo American forces were finally closing the net to the north and south.	What Maurice was specifically ordered to compile was a list of scientists and technicians, together with their field, this list was then forwarded to London.  It was only by accident that he discovered why he had to do this and what happened to those on the list.  This discovery, which was to have far reaching repercussions, began inauspiciously by colliding with Michael Julien in the corridor and being unable to avoid the invitation for a drink without being obviously rude. 	"A couple of right nasties in that Chemical Works at Ebgen."  Julien sipped his drink while looking straight at Maurice.	Maurice thought quickly - Ebgen was about ten days ago.  The list was secret and had gone from him to London.  If it had come to Julien's notice, then he'd assume it was supposed to, after all he was Intelligence.  "Really?"  He gave nothing away.	"You should play poker."  said Julien. "Not even your pupils move. And don't say you knew I knew because you couldn't know."  He giggled and finished the G and T.  He pointed and the mess sergeant poured him another. 	Julien lent forward, "Two of your so-called chemists were not chemists.  What do you think about that?"	"Ah." Maurice said in his hesitant, softest of voices.  Then,  "Not chemists, but Nazis pretending to be chemists."	Julien should not play poker - the surprise on his face was more than obvious.  "You knew?"	"No, I just guessed from what you have been saying."	"What else have you guessed?"	"Nothing."  He would sooner be told than speculate and that way he would learn more.	"We want the best of their scientists for pretty obvious reasons."	"For our own research?"  Julien nodded and Maurice went on, "Even if they happen to be Nazis."	"Precisely.  We can forgive them if they are really useful and, of course, if they say they are no longer Nazis - only joined because they had to, that sort of thing."	"But these you spoke of were Nazis and not chemists?"	"Right, and we don't want Nazis, per se.  So, when you sent the list in and no one could find their past records or publications or anything else to support their claim, other checks were made."	"And some were made by you?"  Maurice had to admit he was quite interested.	"Indeed.   And they were Nazis impure and simple and now they are not in 'holding,' but in a secure POW camp and ripe for trial."  	"Are there many getting through the net?"  he was curious.	"Can't say for sure, but I doubt it.  Checks are pretty good.  Mind you, plenty are trying I gather.  They just don't want their sins to catch up with them and they want out West, not East."	"I can understand that."  Maurice was thinking of some of the things he had heard about both sides on the Eastern Front.	Julien was on his next G and T.  "You know," he was getting very chatty now, "some of them aren't bad fellows, really.   Just doing their duty like us."	"But on the wrong side?"	"Precisely."  There was a pause.  "Sooner have some of them than any of the Communists."  He added quickly, "Some of the top brass think that too."	Maurice remembered some of the things Ernst had said about Germany being a buffer to protect the West.  "The Russians are making great gains, territorially."	"And I can tell you they won't pull back afterwards either."	Maurice was aware of that.  "Could be a problem."	"It will be a problem.  You know what one Jerry said to me?"	Maurice knew he was going to be told and said nothing.	"We should join them and roll the buggers back to Moscow."  He laughed.  	Maurice joined in quietly and nodded.  "What do you do with them?"	"Who?"	"The Nazis you catch."	"Depends."	"On what?"	There was a long silence.  Then Julien spoke very softly.  "If we can use them, or I think we should,"  he paused, "absorb them."	"Ah."	"You're not shocked?"	"No, should I be?"	"Some are."	"How do you absorb them?"	"Fresh papers, clearances, that sort of thing.  Then they come and work for us or they are just ordinary POW's and that's that."	"Risky?"	"To whom?"	"Them, you."	Julien just shrugged.  "Here, have a drink."  He knew he had said too much.	Maurice agreed and the moment of tension passed.	"Nothing said worth repeating."	"Nothing was said." said Maurice and he smiled.	So did Michael Julien and they finished their drinks.Late April, May, 1945.	By late April Maurice was at Gelsthoff near the river Elbe.   Also in Gelsthoff, and in civilian clothes, was Ernst Todt.  	Maurice had been scheduled to visit a small machine tool factory on the edge of the town.  It had been a long and unproductive visit.  He was tired and hungry.  He had  taken a room at the hotel by the railway station and was now walking toward the square looking for a cafe.  Ernst, also tired and hungry, had been travelling by many means on his precarious journey  out of Berlin. He was carrying the papers of a Dutch engineer and was looking for a British or American Officer to report to for clearance for his passage back to Haarlem.  	It was raining slightly, both men had their heads down. It was nearly dusk. As Maurice turned into the square from the hotel, Ernst turned out of it heading for the station.  They collided, drew apart, apologised in German, walked on and turning, recognised each other.      Ernst had his hand in his pocket holding a Luger. Maurice, his hands by his side, faced him.	"Ernst," he said,  frozen, unmoving.	"Maurice Vigor?"  Ernst still had his finger on the trigger.	"Yes Ernst, it’s me."  From across the road Maurice could see a man walking towards them.     He took a couple of steps towards Ernst, his voice low,  "Are you being followed?"      Ernst did not turn, but his eyes widened fractionally.          "Your name, what's your name?"  hissed Maurice.	"Pieter Dutch, from Haarlem."	The man had reached them.   He too had his hand in his pocket.            He held out his identity, "Alan Lomis, Military Police."  He looked at Maurice, "Who is this man?"  He was referring to Ernst.	"This man is an old friend of mine, Pieter Dutch, from Haarlem and I am..."  	"No, let him tell me."	"Maurice Vigor of Leytonstone, East London."  Ernst's English was still good.	"Papers, please."	He looked at Ernst's, then carefully at his face, then back at the papers.     He did not hand them back as he took Maurice's pass.     "Would you care to call Michael Julien, British Intelligence?  He's stationed at the Army HQ with me."  Maurice spoke carefully giving the words as much casual weight as he could."	Lomis was obviously puzzled.  "Are you sure you can vouch for this man?"  He was looking at Ernst who had also taken his hand out of his pocket. 	"I think I should be able to vouch for someone I have known for eight years, wouldn't you?"  He reached out and took his papers back.  "Of course, if you are not satisfied...."  As Lomis grew uncertain of the situation Ernst also reached out and gently took his papers from the slight grip of the outstreached hand.  	"Can you tell me why you are here?"  asked Lomis trying to reassert his authority in the face of his now declining conviction that Dutch was in fact a German trying to slip out of the country.	"No."  Maurice spoke firmly.  "Not until you have the clearance.  The work that Mienher Dutch and myself came here to do is not for discussion on a street corner.  Perhaps it would be better if you came with us to HQ and we can settle everything there.  I really do not have anymore patience to stand here in the rain and cold."  He looked round as if looking for a taxi or other transport.	"That's alright, my mistake.  Can't be too careful though, can we?"	Maurice smiled at him.  "How true."  He took Ernst's arm.  "Good evening, Lomis."  	They began walking toward the railway station and hotel, Lomis stood looking after them until they were out of sight.  He was still not sure, but he was also unwilling to come out of things looking a fool.  If one got away no one knew; if he made a fuss and Dutch was as pukka as Vigor certainly was, then he'd look an idiot.  As he turned to walk back into the square two thoughts ran through his mind.  If Vigor was okay and his papers certainly were, then it was likely that Dutch was okay, so he could forget it.  Unless Vigor was in on something with a Nazi, in which case he should also forget it - Vigor's clearances went very high if the pass was anything to go by.       	"I'm sorry, Maurice."  Ernst was looking tired and strained.  He was sitting in the armchair in the corner of the room.  He had just undone his raincoat.	 Maurice stood looking out of the window.  Shock, surprise, delight, fear, both for his friend and himself jostled with uncertainty.       There was no sign of Lomis in the now deep shadowed square.  He drew the curtains.  He would help Ernst regardless.     He turned, went over to the sink, and poured a drink from the small bottle he had on the shelf.	"What for?"  he asked walking over with the glass.	"This."  Said Ernst taking the Luger out of his pocket and throwing it onto the bed.  "I had my finger on the trigger, I didn't know what you'd do."  He accepted the glass and drained it in a gulp.	"Another?"	Ernst shook his head and shuddered as the spirit tore into his throat on its way down.  "No."  His voice was hoarse.  "No, one's enough."  He handed the glass back.  "I should have known I could trust you, of all people."  	Maurice felt the unforgotten flow of warmth he had missed for so long.  The warmth that came from Ernst's praise, and from being with him.	"It was best, considering Lomis being there, in case."  He didn't really know if the words made sense, but he knew Ernst would understand he was absolving him of any blame or doubt.	"Lomis has been shadowing me for most of the day, something must have made him suspicious."  Ernst sighed.  "I'm not very good at not being me.  Perhaps I was not Dutch enough, too German eh?"	They both laughed.	"You want to get out." Maurice made it a clear statement when the silence after the release of tension needed filling.	Ernst nodded.  "This Reich is finished, a little short of the promised time, but definitely finished."  	"How did you become Pieter Dutch?"	"I left Berlin in a hurry, it was the best I could get."	"And the real Pieter Dutch?"	Ernst looked at him and spread his hands, "The papers were in a Gestapo file," He paused, "I don't think he will need them again."	"But you did and now you need something better."  Maurice was thinking of Michael Julien.  "And you look as if you could eat, I certainly could."	Both agreed it was probably not the best idea to go out and risk running into Lomis again. It wasn't sensible either to alert the hotel to their being two people in the room, someone might say something.	"I'll just pop out and get sandwiches from the cafe and anything else I can.   You'll be alright here tonight and we can work out what's best to do tomorrow."	Ernst smiled.  "Ever practical."	Maurice picked the Luger off the bed.  "Here, safer you have it on you."  He passed it butt first to Ernst.	"Too damn bulky."  Muttered Ernst.	Maurice bent down and took his case from under the bed, he took out the small thirty- two automatic and dropped the Luger into the case pushing it back under the bed.	"Here, take this, it’s lighter and English."	Ernst looked impressed and pocketed it.  "Thanks."  For Maurice, he didn't have to say anymore.		Both were ravenous.           "Why, how," Ernst swallowed, "Are you here, in Germany?"    Maurice briefly explained his job.     Ernst nodded as he ate.     "The wolves descend on the carcass," he said.     "Would you have done otherwise?"  Maurice asked.     "No," Ernst shook his head, "You know we would not."  There was a moment of silence.  Then he added, "Did not."     Both knew there was no room for anything, but honesty.     Later, when they had eaten, Maurice made himself a comfortable place to sleep on the floor,  despite Ernst's protests.             The tiredness both men felt had evaporated with their meeting.  Sleep could now wait.  Talk could not.     This time is was Ernst who insisted and Maurice began his story.  Finally he reached Eric's death, but did not elaborate with dates or place.  The actual event was for him enough to recall. Ernst lent out and put a hand on his shoulder.  He let it rest for a long time, then he spoke.	"A lot of things done in this war were not necessary, especially now."  There was a long pause.  Maurice for a moment wondered that perhaps, had victory come to the Reich, Ernst may not have had need to say that.  Ernst drew a deep breath and went on, "It is unfortunate that he died.  But it is also for you very convenient that he did because from what you say he was becoming very unstable."	Maurice nodded.	The hand gripped reassuringly, then withdrew.  	"You should have no guilt.  You did nothing, there was nothing you could do.  You feel bad about it because you have benefited from the accidental death of another person.  You are not alone in that circumstance."	Maurice looked at him.  "You too?"	"Yes," said Ernst, "Me too.  It is a long story, and like your's, it has not yet ended."	Ernst's voice had the capacity to mesmerize Maurice.  It must be, he thought, the way a cat feels being gently stroked by someone it loves while lying in a pool of warm sunshine.  The words ebbed and flowed with Ernst's memory of the events and Maurice more saw than heard them as his story  illuminated the years of their separation.		“At first it seemed that a new age had really dawned. Berlin was full of light and strength that filled the people and the buildings.  It shone out of the eyes of the old and young alike.  Honour had returned, the country was whole again and now could lead the world.  We all believed in this mission.   We all believed that France and England would not and could not prevent it.  Their time was past.  Now, the time was ours.      How can I describe to you the streets in the sunlight, the white, red and black banners that rippled above us, cheers and adulation surrounded us.  Both black and gray marched everywhere to the inner beat of stirring music and the promise of a thousand years.”	Ernst got up and walked across the room.	"National Socialism and the Volk have not failed, they cannot fail.  What else can stop Communism?"  	He looked at Maurice, there were tears in his eyes.  He turned away from the curtained window, poured a small drink from the bottle and went back to sit down.  He was silent for awhile.  Maurice imagined Berlin, with the pretty willing girls and the boys in uniform and the sense of power that must have emanated from the very earth itself....	'...I was not sent to Poland, but remained in Berlin.”	Maurice realised that Ernst had begun again.	‘I was still studying engineering and hoping for a tank command.  I was so jealous of my friends who came back with medals and victory.  We could not be stopped, who would stop us?  France hid behind the Maginot line, your Chamberlain did nothing, America did not care and Russia took what she could and bought herself time.  Oh my friend, to have lived then in Berlin was to live in ecstasy everyday to be drunk with expectation and to stand on the very steps of destiny.  To know we were the agents of history, that we would shape the world to come.  How I wished you could have been there with me then in that golden moment of time.”	In his heart Maurice knew he wished it, too, to be young and to believe in invincibility and a destiny.  	“We went through France so fast that I was standing looking across at England and wondering what you were doing almost before I realised that we had won again.  Oh how so many of us hoped you would accept neutrality, we did not want war with you.”     Ernst paused, then went on, his voice raised slightly.     "Think how different it could all have been, none of this would have happened.  There would be no Communism and America would have had its own war in Asia, not here.” He paused,  “We will not see either of them out of Europe in our lifetime.  Such an opportunity has been lost by a misunderstanding."	Ernst shook his head sadly.	"We are not the enemy, Maurice.  We brought hope and a new way that is lost, lost for the moment, but it will rise again."	Maurice looked at him.  Ernst had a strange look on his face, as if the suffering and loss of this dream was necessary to ensure the purity and success of the next.	"There were too many people who lacked the vision and only wanted to take, not to give to the Reich.  Men at the top, fat boasting fools who failed, and stupid thugs at the bottom like Lutz."	"Lutz?"  Asked Maurice.	"My particular cross, like your Simms."  said Ernst.  "I will come to him."  	The silence of unsharable memories lay across both men for a few moments, then Ernst began again.	“With the surrender of France I was brought back to Berlin.  That was the end of June 1940.  I had been chosen for promotion and special training, I was to be sent to the East at last.  Kurt Lutz had been at the Training School with me, he was now sent to Special Occupation Duties in Holland and later in France. I was to hear all this when we met again quite recently.  I went to Hungry and to Poland.”	Ernst looked straight at Maurice.	“I will not apologise, what I saw there cannot be described.  I had been prepared for many things but not for this.  I was put in charge of a team directly answerable to Himmler to make detailed photofilm records for the anthropology section of the Race Studies Institute.  I did not want this, I wanted my tank, but orders were orders.”	For a moment Maurice again saw Ernst with his camera, inside a woodpecker’s nest, hanging half out of a tree to take a photograph. He also remembered the thick pile of albums and photographs he had already taken stacked up against the wall of his room.  	“You cannot believe such filth could exist among white people.  These were not homes, they were holes teaming with lice and vermin.  I went to the synagogues, to the schools, to the kosher slaughter houses, to wherever they went I went.  I watched their days and their lives.  We filmed sex, birth, life and death.”	Ernst shuddered.	"For cleaning this Augean stable we will not be thanked because it was all mishandled.  Look at the British Empire's record in Australia and New Zealand, was that not the same?  The American Indian was civilised compared to the Eastern semetic.  Yet we will suffer because of the way, not because of the what.  Too many Lutz's in my world, too many."  	He put his face into his hands and Maurice sat on the arm of the chair beside him and put his arm round the shoulder of his friend.	“One year from the Armistace with France we struck at Russia.  This had been my dream from childhood and my grandfather's dream since he had lost so much to the Bolshevik in the first great war.  Again I was denied my tank, and we followed and filmed as our forces cut deep into the Soviet flesh.  What none of us knew was just how much flesh there was to cut into.  An apparently inexhaustable supply willing to die for a land that burnt by summer and froze by winter.  Again I was not prepared for what I saw.  I went with the thrust north of the Pripet marshes, through Bialystock, Slonim, Minsk and by late August we were at Ostrov and had still only pricked the surface of the country.       “I filmed our victory against ghosts.  They fell back, a man burnt vastness of nothing.  We roasted and they died endlessly.  The villages had nothing, and when we got to them, they were nothing, except a few smoldering sticks and a few old women.  Guderian turned south.  By September he met with Kleist at Lokhvista and we took half a million prisoners.  I was flown there to film it.       “I filmed and the others sent with us took measurements.  If we wanted someone who was still living we made them dead and took the pictures and the dimensions that Berlin needed.  It was a heady drug, to clean up the world race and to undo the misegenation of millennia.  Then came Operation Typhoon to take Moscow.  We were to film the whole thing.  It was to be the beginning of my journey here.”	Maurice could see that emotionally Ernst was exhausted, but he would not stop his story now.  He sent down for hot water, he had cups in the room and some coffee in his bag,  good American coffee that Ernst savoured as if it were fluid from the Grail itself.  They sat, time and worlds apart yet closer to each other than most living things have the fortune to experience, each flowed in empathy into the other.	“October the second began brilliantly as planned.  Hoeppner's group to the center, Guderian and Hoth on the flanks to pocket Vyazma and Bryansk and then on to Moscow and victory.             “On October the seventh 1941 it snowed and Germany lost the war.  I filmed the first snow falling like a lace curtain that lay briefly on the ground and then it muddied by the soles and tracks of men, and became indistinguishable from the ground itself, except that it had contaminated the ground.  I filmed the mud, hours and miles of mud I filmed until it became a part of me that I shall never eradicate until I too become part of the mud.  It swallowed men and vehicles in its vast maw and I remembered the stories old men told of Flanders and the Somme.  Then in November it froze.”	Ernst finished his coffee and Maurice made another.  Memory unwound and in Ernst's silence Maurice could hear the unchanged reel flap flap flapping as he went over those images again and again in his memory before he could bring himself to speak of them.	“The thick brown mud that clung to everything, that smeared clothes and metal and flesh like shit, vanished and was replaced with a brittle white that hurt both to see and to touch.  It became so cold that you could hear metal shrink and you felt the wind in your bones as it cut bloodlessly through the blue flesh.  Sometimes, just by looking, you could not tell the living from the dead.            “The Russians from Siberia had the clothes for that winter.   We did not.  They also had Zhukov, and we had only the order to stand firm.  Then my team was ordered to film the seige of Leningrad, and a transport flew us north just in time for Christmas.  We were there until just after Christmas 1942.  For one whole year I filmed the greatest, most pointless seige in the history of the world.  We could not close off the city because of Lake Lagoda and the Tikhvin forest road and so they died and we died and neither of us got anywhere.  I sent hours of film back to Berlin. I hoped they might see what I saw and stop the waste.  We did not have the time the Russians had, or the men to spare.  If we did not win now we had truly lost.             “If only we had not had to fight in the west as well it could have been a different and better story for all of us. Once again I was ordered on.  We flew out in early January just before the Russians broke out of the city.  When I reached Berlin I was ordered to re-edit the film, to show victory where I had only defeat.   Only victory was acceptable in the movie houses for the masses.       I worked at this for over a month then I heard that Von Paulus had surrendered at Stalingrad.  We had lost in the north and the south.  I had wanted this war with Russia, not with the west.  Now because of one, we had lost the other, and the west we were to lose, too.  I asked to be relieved from filming and to be reassigned to active service.  This I was granted, and I joined in the hopeless task of holding back the Red tide that you are even now letting roll across Europe.  Oh there were little victories, little advances, but always we fell back more than we advanced.  Always in the end we lost ground and as we went backwards we became more crazy.”	Again Ernst fell silent with unspeakable memories and Maurice just sat beside him and waited.	“It was January 1944 that I met Kurt Lutz again and heard his story which then became joined with mine.  Lutz, as I told you, had been sent to Holland, particularly to Amsterdam where there were vast quantities of industrial diamonds, which we needed for our industry. It was his job, with others, to locate, by any means, these diamonds and get them back to the Reich.  I think Lutz's favourite command was always, "By any means".  To him it was a licence for depravity and killing which was often totally unnecessary.  I had the full story that brought him in some disgrace to the Eastern front, but I will spare you all but the necessary details.”	"Another coffee before you continue?"  Maurice could see the weariness etched onto Ernst's face and he himself desperately wanted to urinate.  This done and a coffee in hand he sat back on the chair arm, Ernst sipped appreciatively and continued.	“One of the largest industrial merchants was a Jacob Zollman and it was to him Lutz first went.  He made the usual promises: assist the Reich and you will be allowed your freedom; tell us about others who hold materials we want and you will be rewarded.  I gather he even suggested that passages to Palestine were not impossible.  But, whatever, this Zollman did not wish to protect himself or his family.  Obviously, his wealth was more important to him.      “One day Lutz went to his house and asked him again to be of assistance.  Lutz enjoyed doing things that way.  While they were in the room one of the men with Lutz took a book from the shelf of the library.  It was nothing special, just an old book, but the Jew went mad. He screamed out and leapt at Lutz who immediately shot him. He had the rest of the family arrested and sent away.  What he could not understand was why the old man was so concerned about a book.  He thought about it and the next day he went back to the room.  He pulled the books from the shelves and found a safe.  He was not the most intelligent man, but he was thorough.       I don't know if you knew this, but Lutz's uncle has a bookbinding business in a suburb of Berlin.  Anyway, he was going to blow the safe when the private with him suggested removing the books.  He told me himself, he had no idea if they were valuable. There were a couple of semi-pornographic books, he'd looked and taken them; the rest were just old leather bound things.  That is when he thought of his uncle Wieland, he would have the books crated and sent to him.	“The safe held a lot of cash and many diamonds, so Lutz told me.  He surrendered the diamonds to his superior and kept the money, he said nothing about the books, which duly arrived in Berlin.         “With a couple of other merchants he was more successful, obtaining sufficient quantities of diamonds to make him highly favoured in the eyes of those that mattered.  He was promoted.  He continued his necessary and predatory activities with such zeal that he became an area commander and it was as such that he eventually arrived at a town in north west France, a place called Angoulime..”	"Angoulime!"  Maurice could not help the exclamation.	"You know it?"	"I was there for three months before I came here."  said Maurice.	"Then the platitude that it is a small world is indeed applicable."  replied Ernst leaning forward to put his cup on the floor.     	"The events there are sordid and typical of the man who I wish had never set foot on our estate."  He sighed.	“It appeared that while in Angoulime he indulged in questioning the female populace with some vigour on the grounds that they would know who and where the Maquis were.  He had a degree of success.  When he had exhausted the women he began on the young men with similar success.  One day, however, one of his more willing victims it appears stole something from him.  A book, a stupid C17th picture book, the Chasseur d'Amour or some such title.  He demanded its return and to back up his demand he ordered the shooting of those French suspects currently held in the cells.  He claims he was drunk at the time and also did not know that there was anyone in the cells.  There were in fact twenty-six people who were taken out and shot.  	This provoked massive resistance counter actions and involved a lot of trouble for which he was held responsible.  The end result being his transfer to the Eastern Front which was in itself an insult to the soldiers who are fighting...”	Ernst for a moment was overcome and the story stopped.  After a while he began again.	“Somewhere along the line he must have mentioned my grandfather and the estate because he was posted to the unit I now commanded.   I received orders to keep him in check, but where we were fighting excess zeal gained medals not reprimands.	"When was this?"  asked Maurice.	"He was moved from Angoulime in October 1943.  He arrived in Russia with me in January 1944.  I cannot fault him as a soldier; he was brave to the point of stupidity, but always he survived.  Then, about a month ago we faced a massive surge against us and Lutz was hit, badly, he knew he was dying and, incidentally, I knew that I must get out to the west.  It is hopeless, they cannot be stopped, only you can do that now."	Ernst stood up and paced about for a moment, then he turned and faced Maurice.  	"The Russians were nearly on us, I could not move him, we are SS - you know what they do to SS.  I shot him in the head and ran until I was clear of them.  I kept running and now I am here with his last gift, the books in his uncle's store.  He gave me a note."	Ernst dug in his pocket and took out a crumpled paper.  Maurice read it and passed it back.  All the books sent from Amsterdam and crated in the sequence stated, were now the sole property of Ernst Todt.	"You see," he said, "You have a guilt, but I have a gift and there is no difference." 	"We must get you out, safely."  said Maurice  "And I think I know how."        	He also knew that the book Lapointe had given to Eric and was now in the Angoulime bookshop had the blood of twenty-six people on its pages.  What he could not understand was why such a small theft would have provoked such a senseless retaliation, but then, he had not known Lutz, Pig Face Lutz, very well. 	It was now early morning.  Sleep was essential and they fell onto the bed and the floor respectively and let; as Maurice whispered it to himself,  the unraveller of care knit up their sleeves of exhaustion.	"It’s not quite that easy."  Michael Julien sat at his desk like a supercilious Mandarin.  "Not quite that easy at all."  	How different some people can become when you want something of them and they are in a position of power, thought Maurice.  Were the boot on the other foot, Julien would probably be either very hearty, or he would exude enough slime to make a slug jealous.	"Ah well," Maurice stood up, "It was as I said only a hypothetical question."	"No, don't go, I'm sure I can suggest something, hypothetically, of course."  He steepled his fingers and ran his tongue over already wet lips.  "The problem is you are talking," he gestured to indicate 'hypothetically', "about the SS and they are very difficult indeed to whitewash."  He giggled as if to make a joke, perhaps about the black uniform, but thought better of it and licked his lips again.  "At least he's not wanted on this side, always been on the Eastern Front, you say?"	Maurice nodded.	"Wants to use his own name."	"Yes."	"Could he give me anything?"	"Information."	"Well, yes, that would help, on communists, that sort of thing…"  Julien let the sentence hang.	"Ah, you also mean something specially for you."	Julien moved his head, it was not a nod, but it was affirmation.	"Money?"	Again the slight movement.  "Something like that."	"And then papers and clearances would be possible?"	"Hypothetically yes."	"They would be genuine and non-revokable?"	"Genuine yes," He unsteepled his hands. "As to the other, well, public opinion, political expediency, etcetera etcetera, who can ever say."		Ernst was not surprised at Maurice's report of the conversation, nor at the cost suggested.  	"Would you trust this man?"  He asked Maurice.	"No, but there is no choice.  He can get what you need, but if anything went wrong he could later say he did not know the full circumstances, or something like that.  He'd wriggle out of it, be sure of that"	Ernst smiled at him.  "But are you sure you have that sort of money?"	"I've saved everything I could.  I can pay him what he is asking."	"You know I have," he changed the tense,  "Had, the estate, but I cannot get at anything now and who knows what the end of the war will bring.             	"What will you do now?"	"With the papers?"	"Yes."	"Stay as low as I can until its over and then go back and try to rebuild what can be saved.  What will you do?"	"Whatever I'm told to until its over, then," He paused, "I don't know, I've not thought about it, but I'll find something."	"We will keep in touch."	"Always." said Maurice with the certainty of absolute conviction.     "Then, for the moment, we must put our trust in this Michael Julian," said Ernst.June 1945.                           It was a hot day even for late June and the soft breeze did no more than blow the dust into eyes already squinting from the myrid of suns that bounced from every reflecting surface.  There was plenty of dust and there were plenty of reflecting surfaces.  Where houses and offices had once stood there was now only rubble, glass and the omnipresent dust.  Berlin was a city in ruins.     Quartered by politics, its people moved grey-faced and afraid among the bricks and blackened timbers of their nemesis, uncertain of their tomorrows.  There was no adulation, no glory, no exhultation.  And now, the only inner beat was the blood pulse of their own existence weakened by the failure of a promise.  Daily, the righteous victors brought more and more revelations of the guilt and shame that would be laid before them.  They must eat the dust of defeat, the dust of their own city.     Yet in cellars, in secret places high and low, and in the hearts of visionary men, a Phoenix curled within its egg and waited.  Despite division and defeat there would be a rebuilding and a rebirth that would one day regain all that had been lost.  And more.     Maurice walked along the Dietl Str.  He had left his bag at the hotel.  He would be flying out of Tempelhof with the first half of his group to return to England in about five hours.  Meanwhile, he had an address to find and a parcel from Ernst to deliver.  It was quite heavy and the rough string cut into his hand.     A jeep pulled up beside him, two Military Police jumped out.     "Good morning."  spoken in his best accent.  "Top pocket, may I?"  They were jumpy here and he felt it best to ask first.  They read it quickly.     "Thank you, sir."  A good rich Yorkshire accent and he was back in the jeep.  The surly one looked at the parcel Maurice had put down grateful for the brief respite.  Then saying nothing he joined his companion and they were gone on a swirl of hot dust and petrol fumes.         He'd been questioned three times in the last half hour.  It was being in civilian clothes and this close to the Russian quarter that was probably the reason for it, he thought to himself.    "Please, street, don't be in the Russian sector, please don't be."      Not that he had any reason to fear the Red Allies.  But their bureaucracy was cumbersome.  Their language, apart from Russian, non existent and people did tend to disappear for no reason at all.  If the rumours he had already heard had any credibility.  Maurice suspected they did.       He turned again, Wieland Str  was before him.  It had been badly damaged, whether by bombs, tanks, artillery or street fighting he could not be sure.  There were few people about.  An old man and a woman were loading bricks onto a horse and cart with a slow methodical rhythm that could almost have been an incantation or a long, low wailed penance.  Cart, horse, humans, bricks had all seen better days.      Something to his right glinted in the grass by a stumped tree trunk.  He bent to look - it was a pin broach.  Maurice picked it up.  A gold pin enameled white, red, and black.  The broken cross had a tiny chip in one corner and the underlying metal showed through, yellow bright in the sun.  He dropped it into his pocket.  Then, worried that it might stick him, he took it out and pinned it inside his lapel where it was safe and hidden from view.      Number 46 was the bookbinders that belonged to the deceased Lutz's uncle.  He found 44 and 48, but nothing in between.  No rubble, no hole, no buildings, just 44 then 48.	    A young girl passed,. He called to her, but she just hurried on without looking back.     "She thinks you're going to rape her."  The voice came from a pale, thin face with deep black eyes.  Even in the heat the body was wrapped in an old grey greatcoat.  One leg stood on the ground.  The thin arms held the crutches, splayed out like the legs of a wonton skeleton, while the shoulders were raised almost to the ears.  "Two Russians had her yesterday.  They were not the first either."     Maurice looked at him.       "The first was an American."  He laughed without humour.  "To the victor go the spoils."     "I'm sorry." said Maurice.     "Why?"  It was a genuine question.     "Do you know number 46?"  The thin man disturbed him.     "It is behind you, there to the left of the alley."  A thin crutch rose and pointed across the road.    "Thank you."  Maurice paused, should he give him something.      The dark eyes moved and the pale face turned away, Maurice crossed the road.  He could just read the faint lettering, 'Johann Lutz, Bookbinders.'  The building looked as if it had been burnt, but the lower windows were intact.  He pushed at the door.  It opened into a hall with stairs at the end and doors leading from it.  There  was no sound and after the light of the outside the inside was dark, but it was no cooler.     "Hallo."  he called softly.  The building did not invite noise.  "Hallo."  He waited.     The first door was locked, he tried the next and the next.  As he approached the steps he heard the street door click shut and, without turning, he knew someone was behind him.  There was also someone coming slowly down the stairs.     "Can I help you?"  the voice behind him asked.     "Perhaps you wish a book bound?"  The other voice from the stairs.  He turned back.     In the gloom he could only make out the shapes of men, not their faces.          "I have a delivery."  However nervous he felt he must stick to the words, Ernst had been adamant about that when he had given him the parcel.     "From whom?"  There was a marginal change in the tone.     "An old comrade would like some paper bound up."     "For what purpose?"    "That what he has suffered may not be forgotten."   Maurice waited.    A door to his right opened.  "Come in please, quickly."  Maurice went in.  "You have it?"  He handed over the package grateful at last to let go of the string.     "Please, sit and take a schnapps."  It was more a command than an invitation.     It was still dark, but his eyes had accustomed themselves sufficiently to be able to see a man, in his middle years, unwrapping the package.  A glass was offered him by a woman who had materialised out of nowhere.  He accepted, held the glass and waited.     "It is not poisoned."  Her voice was soft.     "I do not drink much."  Maurice was now more relaxed.     "That is not a bad thing these days."  said the man who was reading the  note.  "Herr Todt says you do not know what is in the package or what he has written."     Maurice nodded.  "Yes."  His voice was steady.     "We do not get many friends from England, especially now."     "I am Herr Todt's friend.  I do not know you."  Sasd Maurice.     "If you are his friend you are our friend and we are yours whether you like that or not."     Maurice said nothing.     "This is no time to discuss tomorrow, nor to apologise for yesterday.  Can we offer you anything?"  Maurice knew that 'anything' had been especially emphasised.    "Nothing, thank you."    "No, it is for us to thank you."    There was silence again, except this time it held no menace, only an expectation and the faintest rustle of paper, or of a Phoenix moving in its egg.     Maurice stood up.  "I must go."     The man nodded.  "I wish you a safe journey. I hope we shall meet again."  He held out his hand.  Maurice shook it.  The woman was watching him.  Maurice picked up the glass, touched the spirit to his lips, met her eyes and handed her the glass.  She smiled at him and her head moved fractionally in approval of his trust.     Outside the light and the heat struck at him bowing his head as if he, too, must bear the guilt the Allies were so freely distributing.  The thin man had gone, but the litany of the bricks continued without pause.      The flight back was less noisy than the one that had brought him and Eric to France just over six months ago.  There were few formalities on landing and the group debriefing had neither urgency nor value.  Later, individually questioned by a bright-eyed girl of about his own age wearing the uniform of WRAC captain, he realised that now it was over in Europe; no one cared much about what had been.  She sympathised with his unfortunate experience at Angoulime, asked if he had any information or views on the German civilian's attitude to the Allies, and did he speak any Oriental languages?  She took his file over to a cabinet in the corner of the Nissen hut office.  She has fat ankles, thought Maurice as he followed the moving contours of her body tight in the khaki cloth.  The buttons of the blouse stood almost on edge with the effort of their containment. Her jacket hung on the chair back.      "Your superior at, er,…."  having slipped the file into the drawer she could not refer to it and had obviously not read it in detail either.     "Fenton Street?" suggested Maurice helpfully.     "Yes, Fenton Street, will have details of leave, postings and any other entitlements."     Maurice stood up; she sat down.     "Thank you."  he said.     "Goodbye and good luck."  She did not offer to shake hands.     So ends my military attachment, he thought, and my Fenton Street days, too. Now what?       The coach from the debriefing center dragged on towards Victoria where they were all to be dropped.  From then on they were to make their own way to wherever they were going.  Maurice had looked only briefly at his companions and each only briefly at him and each other before they had all fallen into an unspoken agreement that there was really nothing to say.  Maurice looked out of the window at the familiar streets.  Windows had lost their criss-crossing and the sandbags had almost vanished.       Washing flapped in some back gardens, children played, people walked to and from shops, there were still uniforms everywhere.  He was hungry and empty.  Here and there a house was missing, a building propped and half boarded showed its private places to uncurious eyes.  The white enamel bath hung half over the torn floor two flights up where the door was shut.  But  the walls were open showing the broken stairs and the changing wall paper down to the brown and cream hallway where dutifully the front door stood hard against the flash charred frame.  The toilet and the sink lay in the rubbled garden with a rusting iron bedframe tangled with bindweed.  As the coach pulled away he caught a last glimpse of a mirror still hanging high up in a pink lofted bedroom.       ‘Now what?'  The thought chased its tail around in his head.  He had no immediate answers, surely there would be no need for Fenton Street in peace time?  Would he be returned to the Treasury section? If he was, could he now, after all that had been, stand to stay there?  If not, what else could he do?      He thought of Eric and the lab.  All that would be cleared away.  The tangle of pots and wires that only Eric could understand, its secrets locked within itself and the yellow wrapped and wired notebook.  He would write for the few things he had left at the cottage; he would not go back there.     The coach juddered to a stop.       "Victoria station."  The driver switched off the engine and reached for his cigarettes.      They filed off one by one unspeaking and dispersing anonymously into the crowds that were training, undergrounding and bussing.             He had felt the scene familiar and yet himself a stranger as he had observed the passing streets and pedestrians from the coach. Upon entering the Fenton Street Office he was struck by the familiarity, startled by the new brightness.      "Nice to see you back sir."  The porter saluted as Maurice entered.     "Thank you."  Maurice stopped looking round.  "What happened?"     "Redecoration, sir.  Ministry of Works is taking over in a couple of weeks.  Your lot's the only ones left in here now."     Maurice ran upstairs.  Soft and carpeted he made no noise as he came to the new glass door that led to the old room.  He went in.  The carpet had preceeded him and had spread itself from windows to wall in lush profusion.  The filing cabinets were still there, and the desks, though bare of their usual burden of trays and papers.  The door to the back room had gone; in its place an archway led into an empty bay.  The 'Laundry' had vanished without trace and so had the kitchen.  He heard a cough and turning saw a door open in the far wall where no door had previously been.  Horace came in, seeing Maurice he broke into a wide smile.     "Well Mo, you're a sight for sore eyes."  He grasped his hand.  "Some changes, eh?  Not for us though."  He shrugged as if such things could never have really been expected.  "Tea?"     Maurice nodded and went to sit down at his desk, Horace came and perched on the end.     "Your movement papers have come in. George is gone already and Brian, back to their original jobs.  I'm for records."     Before Maurice could ask, Fran came in with a tray of tea and biscuits dumped them on the table, and gave him an unexpected hug.     "You're looking lovely.  Being abroad agrees with you."  Then she went serious, "Was it, well, tough?"     Maurice took a cup of tea.  "Enough, but now its over."  He didn't want to say anymore - nostalgia for the room, the job and the team as he now thought of them was lumping his throat.  He couldn't help thinking of the better days with Eric as well.  As those thoughts ran in his mind he remembered the abstracted file still where he had left it.  At the first opportunity he would destroy any of the papers still in it, ensure it had nothing that could link Eric and him in any improper way to the ongoing experiments at the Cavendish, and then get it lost in the Registry.  He ran over it again in his mind: he must bury this end of things as he had buried Eric in France.     "...it must have been quite a shock to you."  He looked up, Fran was speaking to him, concern on her face.  "I mean being so far away, there was nothing you could do."     "No, nothing really."  He hoped that was the right reply.  He didn't want to ask her to repeat what ever it was she had said.     "We're both very sorry."  She put her hand on his arm for a moment.  Horace lit a cigarette, nodding.     Maurice wondered how they knew about Eric.  He also wanted to change the subject.     "Better see where I'm off to."  He pulled the drawer open and took out the brown envelope.  "Pity to see the team broken up though, isn't it?"  They both nodded as he tore it open.  He read quickly, a sinking sensation as he realised his suspiscions had been right.  He looked up at them.     "Back to the Treasury.  But old Chapman must have retired or bought it.  I'm the section leader as from Monday....three weeks."  He'd calculated quickly.  He was on two weeks leave first after what was left of this week.     "Could be worse."  said Horace, typically.  "There's nothing left to do here – we’re all gone five -hirty Friday."  He looked round.  "Bloody Ministry of Works, trust them to do it up special before they move in."     All three of them laughed.      The rest of the afternoon was spent in reminiscences and tea.  It was surprising just how much there was to remember; little things that at the time had been without significance or even comment were now realised as the cement of shared experience, even friendship.  Faces of the living, the lost  and the known dead paraded out of their combined memories, repeopling the rooms and corridors with incident and anecdote.     But they were done.  Their war was over and the war in the Far East had never come to Fenton Street, nor would it in its brief remainder.  In time, however, the dust of its ending would fall on to the pale red tiles of the roof  and tick away the half lies and half lives of a new era as yet undreamed of.     "Its twenty to bloody six!"  Horace leapt up, "I'll miss me train."     They looked at their watches, Fran collected cups.     " Leave them until the morning, get your coat."     It was obvious that she didn't want to do that; she always washed up each evening.      Horace had brought her coat over and was hovering.  "Come on, there's no overtime you know."     "I'll do the cups, you two go on.  See you both in the morning, for the last time."  Maurice stood up.  He shouldn't have added that - Fran was near to tears.       "All good things come to an end love."  said Horace helping not at all.     "Definitely my best war."  repaired Maurice quickly.     "Mine, too."  said Fran sniffing.  "Come on then."     He watched them leave knowing that something had really ended, not just a war, nor a friendship, nor thinking of Eric, nor a life.  No, it was more than that, far more than that, but he could not put it into words.     He took the Simms file out of its hiding place in the back of the amendments file, where if it had been found it could easily have been explained. He emptied the few remaining papers onto his desk.  He read them through reliving the flesh his memory relaid upon the bones of curt and brittle memos to and from himself.  The pain was there and where the pain was so was guilt and still a little fear.  He put the papers in his case to burn in privacy and the file in the last pile that Horace had already strung for their journey to oblivion in the Registry.       There was no more to do.      Maurice went out to catch the bus to Leytonstone and the house, his home, that he had not seen for over six months and had not thought about once with any great nostalgia.  Now as he stood where it had been in disbelief that it was no longer there he was knotted with an unimaginable agony of loss.     "Didn't yer know?"  Mrs. Woods from across the road stood beside him.  "Didn't they tell yer."  She was puzzled.     "I was in France."  he said.     "That's why then."  She was neither interested, nor impressed, just no longer puzzled.  "Yer mum's alright, gorn to Hemel Hempstead.  Yer gran and grandad got it."  She took his arm.  "They was a good old couple.  Never knew nothin' though, just out of the blue and all gorn.  It hit the shelter, see."  He let himself be led into her house and sat down in the parlour.  He could hear her in the kitchen explaining his presence as she made him a cup of tea.       "Mid-afternoon, February 6th.  Yer mum was shopping. V2 straight in, no warnin' with those things...."  She went on and on.       It had landed just behind them in the garden  where the shelter had been and the blast had brought down the house and part of next door.  They must have been in the kitchen.  Their bodies were dug out next day, mum went to aunt Lara's and was still there.  He asked if anything had been left.  He was thinking of his letters from Ernst.      Mr. Woods came in, he was sorry, too, though he had never liked Maurice always thinking him a bit of a pansy.  "The stuff in the cellar was ruined, but I got your grandad's tool box - lost a brass corner, but its here whenever you want it."     The Woods left him to finish his tea and neither of them  ever mentioned to the other the fact that Maurice was crying.           September to December 1945.                           Even with the repainting it was still a poky dark hole, albeit not as poky as the day he'd moved in.  It was funny, thought Maurice as he sat looking out of the small window onto the sloping roof of the next door building that blocked any further horizontal view, but he was sure the room had been larger than this.     It had also appeared to Maurice to be a much grander room when he had last stood in front of this very desk with Mr. Chapman sitting behind it neatly lining up the papers with the edge of his blotter.       "S/C213 missing, Mr. Chapman."     "So it is, Mr. Vigor.  Are you busy?"  And he had looked at Maurice over his half glasses.     "Yes," he had replied.     "Then leave it with me. I will make the necessary enquiries."        The memory, the words, came clearly back to him.  How long?  It must be all of five years ago.  Funny how you could remember the most inconsequential  details of the most unimportant of things.     That had been only the second time he had been in this office.  The first had been his interview for the post of Junior Clerk.  Now he was an Executive Officer, Grade Three.     Now it was his office.  Third time lucky!?     Maurice couldn't help wondering if 'luck' was the right word for it.  Unconsciously, he straightened the blotter.     The door to the office was also shut - ghosts of the undead.  Mr. Chapman did not like clerks in  his sanctum.  He came out to them, said what had to be said, and returned to the liar.       "Funny old cove, just like a lion with a den, but quite nice really."  Lilly's voice came clearly back to him over the years when they sat opposite each other watching the hours creep by as they copied the vouchers into the ledgers.     Maurice wondered what had brought all these memories back today. He'd been back nearly three months now.  Perhaps this was the first day that it had really sunk in.  Here he was and here he would stay until his retirement, with annual increments in pay, of course.  But no further promotion, not without a degree.     Mr. Chapman had retired: Executive Officer, Grade three, to Frinton by the Sea.      Lilly was dead.  She had died in an attack on the Ventnor Radar station during the early part of July 1940.  Poor Lilly, she had wanted to join the WRAF's so much and to do her bit.  Well, she had done it and died under half a ton of reinforced concrete that had fallen across the plotting table.     Maurice had only found that out a couple of weeks ago when he had bumped into one of the women who had kept in touch with her when she had got her posting and who was still working in the building.     He shook his head. "Still here," he muttered.  But then, so was he.      The longer he sat in the office - he still could not think of it as his office - the more it appeared that he had never been away.  For the most part, the men under him (he assumed the girls too, though there were less of them each day as marriage and babies took their toll,) were glad that those uncertain years were over.       Now, despite continuing rationing, despite the war that the new Labour government urged everyone to fight to regain our lost markets, there was a certainty that had not been there before.  There was a promise, too, of a better life, a reconstruction of society with no return to the old ways. There would be education, health, housing, jobs and a fairer distribution of the Country's wealth.  The war was over and the battle for a just society had begun.  But as Maurice stared out at the roof with the tiny grass patch growing in the corner of the gutter, he felt that something had been lost.     He was Maurice Vigor, Civil Servant, aged 27, single and alone.  The Third Reich had fallen, the South East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere had atomised, the Anglo-American's had the bomb and policed the world, and he was back in the Treasury Office in Holborn, London.       "Oh Eric."  He spoke softly, there was now only a little pain and guilt, but there was a loss.       He reached out for the day's schedule and centered it in front of him.  There was work to do, but his mind would not concentrate.     His mother was going to stay with aunt Lara. He had a pleasant room in Chalk Farm; he had a secure job for life; he was rebuilding his savings.    For a brief moment he wondered if he had died.    The knock and the door opening were inseparable.    "Can you sign these, Mr. Vigor?"  It was the smooth bril-creamed Harry Johnson to whom Maurice had taken an instant aversion.  He had neither manners, nor respect.  He aped the cinema Americanisms and was, by all accounts, extremely successful with the girls.  He dumped the ledgers on the desk and lounged, waiting.     "Thank you, Mr. Johnson."  Maurice kept his voice neutral.  Johnson had not moved.  "Was there anything else?"     "No, sir, I thought I'd just wait to take them back."     They both knew that all Maurice had to do was initial the bottom of each page, a matter of no moment.     "I'll send for you to collect them.  Thank you."  It was as deliberate as it was pointless, but it was, for Maurice, also necessary.  Johnson looked at him then left without further comment. Maurice could imagine what he would be saying to the others out there, he had once overheard himself referred to as 'The Little Tin God.'      The days came and went. Saturday afternoons were spent at the local gymnasium. Sundays saw Green Line coach trips to the countryside or to historic houses.      He read, and spent time in old bookshops.  By now he was known in many of them as a discerning small value purchaser of late nineteenth century novels, and he felt very much alone.  He had a brief aquaintanceship with a man he had met at Kew Gardens in the  summer.   They had been to the theatre twice and shared trips out on Sundays.  But neither of them wanted to take it further.  Later he saw him with someone else and felt only relief.  A sudden unconsumated lust for a young man in a Hampstead toilet brought in its train only a disturbing week of dreams about Eric and a growing sense of the total emptiness of his life.      By the end of that October he knew that he could not continue his job in the Civil Service.     The problem was he did not know what else he could do.  He thought of Kenya; he had read an article about White Africa which had attracted him.  But he was without any saleable skill and he knew he did not have the confidence to risk a 'venture' as the writer had described 'taking off and having a go.'  Maurice put that down to his working class and fatherless background.  At least reading gave him credible explanations if nothing else.     Then, on the twenty-first of November, two weeks after his twenty-eighth birthday, he returned from work, let himself into his room, and found Ernst sitting in the  armchair with a glass a Schnapps in one hand and a copy Punch in the other.     "This is not a very funny magazine."  said Ernst.     "No, it isn’t."  Said Maurice.       Neither spoke for the next minute.  They just held each other in the joy of meeting again.                   "How did you get here?"     "You mean here, or England?"  Ernst was smiling at Maurice's very obvious amazement at seeing him.     "Both."     "I told your landlady I was an old Dutch friend, which is not so much of a lie, and she let me in to wait.  As for England, I am here for a meeting with your Plessey Company to obtain licenses to manufacture components in Germany.  You see, now I am a representative for Kohl-Scheel Gmb.  Legitimate and respectable, thanks to you my old friend."     "You look well."  said Maurice.     "I am well, but you do not look happy with yourself.  I could read this also between the lines in your letters."  He paused for a moment.  "I am sorry about your grandparents."     "Yes."  said Maurice simply, there was really no more to say.  "Tea?  I have a kettle and a ring."  He pointed to the small curtained area in the corner of the room.       Ernst raised his glass.  "Schnapps against the English damp."     "So you have had no problems, the papers have been okay?     "So far so good as you say, so far so good.  I have friends in the new government who are also taking care of things, I think it will be alright."     "And business?"     "That, too, is good.  There is a lot to rebuild and with the, how shall I put it, suspicions about the Soviet intent that is prevalent among the Americans, it is easier than I could have hoped."  He drained his glass.  "But I am more concerned about you, Maurice.  What are you doing with your life?"     "I am back at the Treasury accounting office and I hate it."  He was always honest with Ernst.  There was little point in trying to hide anything because he always saw through pretence.     "Then you should not be there."  He poured another drink and one for Maurice who took the proffered glass.  "To the future, my friend, to the future."     Maurice drank and coughed to Ernst's gentle amusement.  "To the future."  He at last managed in a strained voice.     Ernst lent forward and put his hand on Maurice's arm.  "Will you do something else for me?"     "Of course, anything."  Maurice meant it, too.  Just to be asked by Ernst gave him pleasure.     Ernst nodded.  "I know that, but I would want you to be happy doing it.  I will tell you, if you do not like the idea, then say so, please."  He lent back in his chair.  "Would there be some music, perhaps?"       For a moment Maurice was puzzled.  Ernst made a listening gesture, his hand to his ear.  Maurice understood and reached to the radio, it lit up, warmed and he tuned to the Home service where a concert of light music swelled into the room.  He adjusted the volume and lent back.  Ernst nodded.     "I and some of my old friends, you understand whom I mean?"        Maurice did.     "We need someone whom we can trust absolutely who is above suspicion in all ways, to act as a..."  He paused significantly,  "...a link man that we can all get to without too much difficulty, someone central."     Maurice nodded.     "We do not want to see Communism spread any further than it has.  In what is left of Germany and in France and Italy there are already danger signs.  Here you have a Labour Government that is sympathetic to them, perhaps, certainly no more than that.  But, who knows what may come in time.  America is basically sound, but we don't want American domination in Europe because of a Communist threat we ourselves cannot contain.  You understand?"     Maurice held up his hand.  "I'm not a political thinker, Ernst, and never will be.  But, I could not live in a so-called Marxist worker state.  I believe in freedom."     "Then help us and one day, perhaps even many years away, but one day for certain, you will see that freedom even in Russia itself.  That I promise you."     Maurice could feel the force of Ernst's will and conviction sweep over him, absorb him, and carry him along with it.  Here was a purpose, here was a dream and an ideal that meant something and he was being asked to be part of it.     "How can I help with what you want and need?"     "Would you be willing to leave your work and come to live in France?"     "Yes."  He didn't even have to think about that.  "But how?"     "Leave the paper work to us; that will be no problem."  Ernst was grinning at his simple enthusiasm.  "How would you like to run a bookshop like the one you told me all about for so many hours?  You remember?"     Maurice did remember. "Angoulime."  He said.     "Exactly, but not in the countryside - in Paris itself."     Maurice shook his head,  "I would love to, I can't think of anything I would love more, but to buy the books, rent a building...."  He had thought about such a venture in London, but the cost had been way beyond even borrowing and he had  dropped the whole idea.     "You would expect to use your money again?"  Ernst was genuinely moved.  "After what you have already spent helping me?"           "Well, I mean things are very difficult for you, the newsreels and the papers..."     "Maurice, you are one of the most, if not the most precious people I have ever met."     Maurice was not exactly sure what Ernst meant by that.     "My dear friend, we already have the building, a small shop in La Rue de la Chat Qui Peche, Ninth Arrondissment.  It used to be a leather goods and saddlery, near our old cafe, remember?"  He smiled.     Maurice remembered.     "You remember Johann Lutz, Bookbinders?"     Maurice nodded.     "And that I told you of certain books once belonging to Karl Lutz who acquired then from a Jewish merchant, now by the gift of death, mine?"     "Yes."     "Then if you have no objection to their provenance and means of aquisition, I give them to you as your first stock and in part repayment of the debt I owe you."     Maurice felt his mouth open, but he could make no sound.     "Well, it looks as if you have a shop and some books, so when can you begin business?"     At that moment Maurice knew he had never been happier in his whole life.  He held out his hand and Ernst gripped it for a long time.  The bond first made nine years ago was now sealed for life.          Writing the letter of resignation should have been the easiest thing to do, but it was not.  Certainly Maurice wanted to leave the Civil Service.  He also wanted to do something that would interest him and he desperately wanted to be part of something larger than himself. Ernst's offer gave him all of these.  Yet now there was a hesitancy.  He could hear his grandfather's voice muttering 'security' and he could feel his own uncertainty coiling and uncoiling deep in his bowels.  He knew he was  afraid of the future.     He pulled the paper towards him and began to write.  As he finished the letter he realised he had begun the next phase of his life.  He drew his journal from the shelf.  He had not written for some weeks; now there was much he wanted to say to himself.     The next morning he rang the hotel number Ernst had given him; he would be free to leave in one month.  By then, he would have cleared his notice on the room and told his mother that he was returning abroad.  Ernst had said little.  He would see him again in three days.  He was returning to Germany and all would be ready.  He gave him an address in Paris and hung up.  Maurice decided to say nothing  at work; they would know he was going soon enough.  He would also make up a parcel to leave at the bank and take only his current apologia with him. The old journals need not accompany him.      During the next few days he lived in a euphoria of hope.  Ernst had been encouraging: he had fired him with confidence both in himself and in the work he would do.  As he waited now for the time to pass he thought again of breaking the self imposed celibacy that he had consiously continued after the after the death of Eric, even though desires had returned.        Once again he realised that it was not sex per se that he sought - that was all too simple and ultimately empty.  What he wanted was what he had had for some time with Eric.  A relationship,  a dominancy that was needed and at the same time resented by a partner.  Only this gave him the excitement that he craved, to give and to withhold, to tempt, to serve and yet to rule.  However, his thoughts on this subject stayed as thoughts.  He was in no position to either hope for or to seek a partner, or to risk the casual encounters that were fraught with the danger of unjust and cruel exposure by pretty policemen who baited the unwary.     His last day at the office, the day before Christmas eve, coincided with the office party.  Whether it was that, or the fact that no one knew he was leaving, or if they did, did not care, saw no one wish him good luck or good bye.  He emptied his desk, made brief excuses that allowed him either to attend or not attend the festivities, and walked out into the cold drizzle of a dark mid-winter London evening.  His boat train left Victoria at six twenty-six the next morning.  He would go to a hotel for a meal and his last night in England.  Maurice had decided that whatever, he would not return.     By nine thirty, he had eaten, had one small whisky and was haunted with a discontent and an anger he could not explain.  It was not his intent to walk towards the Holborn office, nor to go in through the side door, and up towards the sounds of the party, but that was where he found himself.  He stood in the shadows of the landing.  He could hear voices, music, and the silly, abandoned merriment that went with a release from the strict observance of everyday practice permitted by the holiday and amplified by this, the first peacetime Christmas for six years.       He slipped unoticed into the main corridor and on into Chapman's, his, old room by the back door. He inched the door to the main office open.  There were dimmed lights, streamers dancing and a table with empty dishes and half-empty bottles to his left.  To the right, couples stood just moving in a pretence at dancing.  Only the young ones were still there; the attached and the elderly had already left.  All the while he stood watching wishing he had not come, yet he could not force himself to leave.  From the far shadows he saw Johnson emerge with a girl on his arm, it was the dark-haired temptress who shared the same desk, he tried to recall her name, Joyce, no, Joy.       He realised they were slowly making their way toward the very door he was standing behind, by the way they kept looking to see if anyone was noticing their surreptitiuos progress.  Now absolutly certain of their intent, he slipped back into the office and out of the back door leaving it sufficiently ajar to see and not be seen.  If they came right through, he could hide in the shadows of the roof steps while they descended.      He heard them enter the office and the main door click shut.  They had not noticed the crack made by the passage door. Maurice waited.  They were staying in the room; all they sought was privacy and he turned to leave.     "No."  It was her voice followed by a giggle.       "Alright then, no."     He turned back to the crack.  He could just make out Johnson standing by the door, he heard the soft click of the key being turned.  Johnson moved out of view, the girl crossed his line of vision, and he could hear movement and the sounds of garments and cloth.  He edged slowly nearer to the peephole of the door, his eyes widening to pierce the gloom of the office.  Now they were both visible, the girl against the edge, of the desk the man against her his hands busy on her body, their mouths locked.  Her dress was drawn high and as she moved, the pale ivory tusk of flesh glinted in the little light.  Maurice heard, more than saw her penetrated.  Their breath juddering in time  with the man's pumping buttocks.  He caught the acrid smell of sweat and sex as they both cried out in their release.  Maurice turned and went down the steps.  The final ignominy, he thought, to use his office for that.     It was the first and last time he had thought of that room as his office.      For a moment his eyes hurt in the brightness of the street with its fixed and passing lights that picked him out and spun  his solitary shadow around him in a mocking dance of its singularity.  This was to be his last evening in the city of his birth and youth.  But, it was not the city of his aging.  That had come to him in Europe, as it had to many men in their witnessing of death and in their sure and certain knowledge of its return for them.      He walked on towards Tottenham Court Road still thick with traffic though there were now fewer pedestrians.  A woman beckoned from a shadowed doorway and he broke the beat of his step.  She moved into the light.     "Hallo, dear."  She was young, her voice had a softness, she was not from the south.  Her skin was hard in the broken light and the cheap coat cuther small body into unflattering angles.  Maurice looked down at her scuffed shoes and stocking legs that spoke of long standing in hope and wind.     “Its ten shillings.”     "Anything?"  Maurice spoke harshly. She flinched, then nodded.  "My hotel."  he said surprising himself with the suddenness and certainty of the words.     "Alright."  She came up beside him.  "Is it far?  I've got to get back here."     Her desperation excited him.       "Victoria."     He watched her indecision, the struggle between the money and the distance.  This was the penultimate day before Christmas, surely she would not have much custom now.  He smiled and made a slight move as if to walk on.  She caught his arm.     "Alright.  A hotel you said?"  She was thinking of the warmth and the comfort of lying on a bed instead of being pressed against the rough bricks of the adjacent bomb site.      Maurice hailed a cab, letting her in before him as he gave the address.  He sat away from her, stiffly, holding on to the strap as it swung down Charing Cross Road and round Cambridge Circus.  The girl said nothing.  Her eyes left him and she watched the Christmas shops reading their promises made for other people.     He would go into the bar first, have a drink, and then he would take her up to his room by the back stairs and so avoid any problems with the clerk.  The cab jerked to a stop, he paid, and gave a tip enough to earn him a Merry Christmas.     They sat in the corner unnoticed by the other guests and the drinking non-residents who preferred the quiet anonymity of this more gentile backstreet to the noisy geniality of the nearby pub.     He bought her a gin without thinking to ask.  She took it with a white, cold hand.       "How old are you?"  his voice was high, but quiet.     "Twenty-two."  Came the automatic answer.     Less four years at least, he thought.     "Another?"     He was drinking halfs of beer so watered as to be without threat.  The spirit coloured her cheeks and the tip of her nose.       This was what men did.     She finished her drink and Maurice stood up.  They left as unnoticed as they had entered and went to his room.     "No, don't, leave it on."  She stood one arm out of her coat, the blue cardigan pulled to one side revealing the thin white blouse lifting against her breast.  "I'll tell you what to do."  She returned her arm.  "Just sit over there."  He pointed to the small chair by the bed.     "Can I smoke?"  She was unsure.     He nodded and she drew a torn packet of Lucky Strike from her coat pocket.  The match filled the small room with sulfur.  He got up and turned off the light.  The room moved with the changing shadows as the street light underlit the sparse furniture and the silent figures, then froze.  He watched her smoke drift to the ceiling and it caught in his nose.     "Open your coat."  She did so.     "Pull your skirt up, right up.  More."  She was uncomfortable now, her legs exposed.  "Open your legs."  He could feel her tension across the room.  He moved towards her. Standing by the end of the bed, he looked at the empty space between her legs where the black satin had pulled tight against her.     This was what men did.     He looked.     "What you going to do?"  She was afraid.     He took a pound out of his pocket and threw it onto the bed, her eyes saw, but did not leave his face.     "Nothing."  He said more gently and she relaxed.     They remained apart, in silence.     He was curious.  He had never seen a woman naked.     He gestured with his hand at her buttons and she began to undo the cardigan, then the blouse. He gestured again and she struggled behind her back until the catch undid and she lifted the cups freeing her small breasts.  She sat unmoving.     He had no desire for her, but he had paid her fee and more.  He watched her stub out the cigarette in the ashtray by the bed.  She looked back up at him.  He wondered what she was thinking.     Was she afraid he would hit her?         "Stand up, please."     She stood.     "Everything."     She hesitated.     "Please."       She undid her skirt and it fell to her ankles, empty and crumpled.     She stepped out of it and bent to pick it up covering herself for a moment before she laid it on the chair.  The cardigan blouse and brassier joined it.     Maurice nodded.     She stepped out of her panties.  Clad now only in suspender belt and stockings.       Then they joined her clothes on the chair.     She was thin.  Her ribs were clear below her breasts, indenting the smoothness of her skin.   The cold, or fear, had hardened her nipples and they threw tiny shadows of their own.  There was no muscle.  The curve of her belly ended in the black triangle that separated her legs.  Thin legs that left a gap where there should be none.     Maurice moved slightly and a sudden fear tightened her face.     "Turn round,please."     She moved slowly, afraid.     Thin blue veins marked the back of her knees.  Her buttocks, round, unhollowed, dimpled at the base of the spine.  Boney, it ran past her curving shoulders and was lost in the waves of dark hair that caught the little light from the window.  The back of her left arm was bruised.         "Face me."     She turned back, relieved.     Her body had no urgency, no want, no need.  There was nothing to show.  Had she desire?  Maurice could not tell.     "Thank you."     Her head moved slightly in the direction of her clothes.     Maurice nodded and she began to dress.     He wondered if her lover or husband was dead, or had left her. Did she have a child that some old woman took in for the evenings while she worked her souless shift accepting the blunt brutality of faithless men?      Though the room was not cold, she shivered and it broke the distance that had lain between them.     He stood beside her and gently ran his hand over her face, like a child or a blind man who is only curious.     They stayed like that for a long time.            She waited until he stood away, then finished dressing.     "You can get a taxi back."  He handed her two shillings.              "Can you see me out?"     He did not refuse her. January 9th. 1989.                                  		Matthew could smell laundry.  The phone was ringing and his mother shouted from the kitchen for him to answer it.  Tom stood in the doorway, rabbit and gun in hand.  Matthew turned over and the ringing grew louder.  He sat up and grabbed the phone.	“Good morning, Mr. Vigor.  It is half past seven.” 	The line went dead.	Matthew didn’t remember asking for a wake up call.	He rubbed his eyes in the curtain-filtered daylight.  The last rags of the dream fled.	He pondered breakfast while he showered and shaved.		There was coffee and pastries and a copy of the Guardian in the lobby.  He took the paper and balanced cup and plate back to his room.		The car came at ten and he returned the paper on his way out.  It was a beautiful sharp morning.  Bicycles wove about them, their bells tinkling clear passage along the cobbles and over the short, hump-backed bridges.  The car turned down a narrow passage, passed a small synagogue, and drew up alongside a high wall where a wooden door was let into the red brick.  The iron fastenings glinted with polish and age.  	The driver, still wordless, opened the door for him and then pulled on a silent handle before returning to the car and driving away, leaving him alone in the short dead end street.		The wooded door opened.	“Mr. Vigor?”	He nodded.	“Please come in.”	The English was almost without accent.  The pale-eyed transparent-skinned old woman in black skirt and cardigan led him along a narrow gravel path through tight-trimmed grass toward a house whose elegance and style proclaimed wealth and great history.	She tapped on the french windows that looked onto the lawn and then pushed them open for him.	“Please go in.  Mienher Zollman is in his study.”	She glided silently away as he entered.		Light streamed into the room from a row of clerestory windows either side of him.  The walls were lined with bookcases from floor to the lip of the high windows.  Three ladder lecterns jutted out on polished brass runners.  A leather armchair was set on a woven rug before a fire whose grate held a bowl of flowers.  In the center of the room was a great desk.  Heavy and solid, it was easily capable of bearing the cascade of books and papers that sprawled on its polished surface.  His eyes were drawn first to a deep, dark-stained tear in the wood by one leg, and then to the man who spoke.	“It was kind of you to come, Mr. Vigor.  Forgive me for not rising, but I avoid it whenever possible.”	A broken, twisted hand waved Matthew to a chair.	“Please sit.”	He must be in his eighties, thought Matthew as he settled facing the old man whose shock of white hair dominated the lined face and the sharp bird black eyes.	“I know you will have many questions at my intrusion into your life.”	The voice was strong and carried a sense of intense purpose that transcended the frail body that gave it home.  The thin neck rose tortoise like from the loose collar of the shirt and jacket.	“However,” the voice continued, “If I tell you something of my life it will be clear why it is part of your life, as it is part of everyone’s life.”  He paused.  “I am a Jew.”	Matthew nodded. 	“And I knew your father.”	Matthew sat up.	Zollman smiled knowing he had Matthew’s full attention.	“My story is a small part of a very old story for European Jews.”  Zollman settled himself.	“My father was a diamond merchant, here in this house, as had been his father before him.  My family have lived in Amsterdam for a very long time, always as merchants.  But more than that, they were collectors and patrons of artists.  While their own art was making money they appreciated beauty in all its forms - music, paintings, books.”	He looked at Matthew and then continued.	“I was studying music as well as the diamond business.”  He held up his tortured hands.  “But in 1944, the Germans broke my fingers so I could no longer play.”	Matthew could not help wincing and it gained a nod of approval from Zollman.	“My father was shot by them in this room and my family taken to Germany.  Only I and my youngest brother survived.  You have met his daughter already.”	Matthew nodded.	“The Germans liked art, but not as patrons, only as collectors.”	He indicated the shelves.	“All first and rare editions; once there were more.  When I returned from the camps, the room was bare.  They had taken everything.  The family’s money, the paintings, the books, even my family.”	Matthew noticed a worn gold wedding ring deep in the gnarled finger.  	“I came back and I made more money.  But money cannot buy back the dead.  But it could buy their possessions and those of my pillaged friends whose ashes blow round the world.  It was not easy at first.  There were few records, many denials and no Nazis.  Only soldiers who did not steal or rape.”	The bitterness of his voice razored the space between them.	“Sometimes someone would hear of my search, or read my advertisement that was in every paper, and they would sell my books back to me claiming they were found, or just come upon.  Sometimes a parcel would just arrive to assuage guilt, or from a widow seeking forgiveness for a husband, or from a mother for her sons.  So, little by little they returned to me.  As war memories dimmed, I redoubled my efforts.  Every sale, every catalogue yielded a volume here, a volume there.  I still hunt for them and now I have my niece to help me.  And yes, I have records, records as detailed as any Tuton.”	Matthew shifted his position slightly.	“I do not bore you?”	“Not in the least,” Matthew kept his voice as neutral as possible.  He knew all that had been said was in preparation for something now to be said.	“Your father ran a bookshop.  I do not mean the one in London.  That sold only ordinary books and cheap, shallow, vicious politics.  I mean the one he had in Paris after the war. I see you know of it.”	“In the Rue de la Chat que Peche.  Yes, I heard of it very recently.”	“Now it is long gone, but it was there from 1946 to 1952 and it sold very special books.  Books of great rarity that could only be viewed in the upper rooms by purchasers who had been vetted for lack of curiosity and sufficiency of funds.”	Matthew was about to speak, but the hand stopped him.	“The sole owner of the shop was Maurice Vigor and he would not sell me any books.  Neither would he let me see his catalogue.  In small things your father could be adamant.”	“Are you saying that my father sold looted books after the war?”  Matthew could not keep the anger from his voice.  “And are you saying he knew they were looted and did not care?”	“Yes, I am saying that and I am sorry for the pain it causes you to hear it.”	Matthew caught the insincerity.	“I have proof.”	“Proof?”	“Your father was in Germany during the last months of the war with a team who investigated military factories.  He met a Nazi who wanted out to the West.  The name was Ernst Todt and I know he bribed your father to help him with looted books that he had shipped to the Paris bookshop from a Berlin Book Company called Lutz.”	 Matthew froze as his thoughts raced.  This was similar to the story Julien had told him and he well remembered the Editions Lutz.	“You say you have proof.”	“I have the death testament of a member of the French Resistance who knew your father had the Chasseur.”	“That is one book.”	“Where there is one, there are many.  I visited the Paris shop.”	“But you did not see upstairs.”	“I did not have to, I knew.”	There was a righteousness and an arrogance about Zollman that grated on Matthew.	“You have the Chasseur.”	“No,” said Matthew, “I do not have it.  It is held in Probate.”	“Ah, there was no will.”	“No, no will.”  He paused, then wanting to end the conversation, “But I have seen the page.”  He drew the photocopy from his pocket and passed it over the desk.	Zollman looked and sighed.	“You will sell it to me.”	“No,” said Matthew, “I will not sell it to you.”  In small things he, too, could be adamant.  “But when it is released from Probate I will send it to you.  He stood up.  The atmosphere was choking him and he wanted out of the house.	“Thank you, Mr. Vigor.  I can wait a little longer.”	He rang a bell and the French window opened.	“The car will take you back to the hotel.”	“Thank you, but I would sooner walk.”	“As you wish.” 		The wooden gate closed behind him and Matthew drew a deep breath as he turned out off the lane and walked past the synagogue.  As far as he could remember it, the hotel was over the bridge, left and then straight on down.		He had not been in his room more than twenty minutes when the phone rang.	“I’m sorry if he upset you.”  Marion’s voice immediately soothed his cumulative irritation.	“He get’s very single-minded, but he doesn’t mean to be offensive.”	“I’ve told him he can have the book as soon as I get it,” said Matthew.	“I know.  Your plane doesn’t leave until tomorrow, does it?”	“No, yes, tomorrow two pm.”	“Then let me show you the city this afternoon, please?”	“I’d like that,” he meant it.	“Ten minutes?”	“Okay and thanks.”	The line clicked dead and he stepped into the shower and clean clothes.	Marion was true to her word and there was a tap on the door just as he knotted his tie.	“Well, ready for the best tour guide in the business?”	“And what business is that?” 	She laughed and took his hand.	“Got the key?”	He patted his pocket as the door clicked behind them.	“We’ll start with a canal ride and then lunch, possibly a museum or gallery, and then shops.  What do you think?”	“Sounds good,” he said.		They took the standard canal tour, despite a wind that whipped the trapped water into miniature wavelets. Marion’s commentary was far more entertaining than the captain’s.  She was a lot prettier, too.  At no time did she mention her uncle or books.  For that Matthew was most grateful.  By the time she did, any rancor at the meeting had evaporated and he was ready to talk.  They were in the Rijksmuseum standing before the “Night Watch.”		“With him, it is an obsession, like a quest, really.”	“I understand, well, I can appreciate, no I can’t....”	“You are very honest Matthew.  If you haven’t been through it how could you.  But at least you are open, however much you may not care for him.”	Her candor left him without words.	“Has he many left to find?” he finally asked.	“There are not enough books, or paintings in the world to fill the gap he is trying to fill.  Searching for them just keeps the horror far enough at bay to allow him to live.”	Now that, thought Matthew, must be world’s greatest conversation stopper.	“Is he only after books?”	Marion looked at him.	“In that, I include paintings, and other works of art.”	“You mean, is he a Nazi hunter?” 	“Yes I mean, is he a Nazi hunter?”	“No.”	“Just like that, no?”	“Just like that, no.”	Matthew looked out at the passing houses, remnants of the mercantile aristocracy of Amsterdam and wished he were back in Camden.  For one moment, he almost wished he were back at school.	“What does he do if he finds one, or evidence?”  	Curiosity won.	 Marion shrugged.	“There are channels,” she said.  	“He didn’t ask me if there were any more books in the shop.”	“Are there?”	“No, but he didn’t know that, so why didn’t he ask?”	“Perhaps he did know, he is not without contacts.”	I bet not, thought Matthew.	The boat was returning to the quay and people were beginning to stand up.	“There’s something on your mind, isn’t there?” she asked softly taking his hand as they skittered down the gangplank and over to look at the embarkation photos.	“In a safe in the shop’s cellar I found some old catalogues from the Paris shop your uncle referred to as a ‘looted book store’ that he says my father owned and ran.”	“You still have them?”	“Not here.  I left them in the safe.”	He decided he may as well go the whole way and be done with it.	“There was also a list of names and addresses, sort of subscribers, I guess....”	“What!”	“Not real addresses, just Post Office boxes all over Europe.”	“Don’t say anymore.  Kiss me.”	Before he could question the order, she put her hands to his face and kissed him as she whispered.	“There’s a bench behind us.  Sit on it.  Kiss me.  Tell me you love me, or want me, or anything.”	 “But...” he muttered against her lips.	 “Do it!”  The whisper was now a hiss.	They sat close on the bench.  He put his arm round her, the warmth of her thigh against his unsettling.	“You’re beautiful.”	Her mouth was by his ear.	“Is that it?”  she whispered running her hands round the back of his neck.	“Very beautiful, and I want you.”	Truth made it more difficult to say.	“Invite me back.”  	Her lips nibbled his ear and he felt himself hardening.	“Come back to the hotel, now.”	“How masterful,” there was a throaty giggle behind the words.	They stood up and he kept his arm about her waist feeling the movement of her body as they walked.	They kept up the pretence in the cab and through the lobby.  Remembrance of the condom on the table embarrassed him.	She shut the door, turned on the TV, and pulled the curtains shut. The TV was still on the porn channel and she raised her eye at him as she flicked the channel to a noisy incomprehensible sit com.  Her demeanor instantly changed as she motioned him to sit on the edge of the bed while she pulled the chair up toward him and sat carefully.  He couldn’t help looking at her knees.   	“What does the name Ernst Todt mean to you?”	Matthew thought of the picture on his father’s bedroom wall, of the wreath and the   journal.	“My father knew him before the war and they were in touch afterwards,” he said.	“Todt escaped to the West just before the end of the war with your father’s help. In return he gave him valuable books to sell in his Paris shop.  I’m sorry Matthew but this is true.  Todt was more than just an escaped Nazi. He was a committed Nazi who wanted to rebuild what had almost been destroyed.”	“Go on,” he said.	“Todt also ran both an escape route for other Nazis and a network of sympathisers who would be the core of a rebirth.”	Matthew shook his head.	“There were plenty who hated Communism more than Nazism, despite everything.  Much of that would be blamed on individual excesses, not on the creed.  Maurice was the bookeeper for the Phoenix Group.”	Phoenix, he thought, On the crumpled letter in the bin, that first day in the flat, a bird with its wings in leaves - that was a Phoenix rising from the ashes.	“Oh my God,” he said and let his head fall into his hands.	She reached out and took his hand in sympathy.	“I’m so sorry,” she said again.	“Even when he returned to London?”	“No, we don’t think so.  It was only in the early years.  In London it was just selling ordinary books and an old friendship.”	‘Who was we?’  The thought chased through his head.	“We? We think?”  he asked.	She looked at him without change of expression.		“You’re not his niece, are you?”	“No.”	“You are one of the channels.”	“Yes.”	“My father is dead.”	“I know Matthew, we don’t want the small fish.  We want Todt.”	“And the catalogues will help?”	“The lists will, as evidence, and they had members of Phoenix coded into them.”	“Is Todt still active?”	“Very.  He controls a network of old Nazis who have been reabsorbed into West German business and politics and many in East Germany.  He is known to visit some of the Neo-Nazi groups, too.”	“How long have you known about my father?”	Marion was silent for a moment.	“David Zollman knew he had the book he wanted and knew about the Paris shop.  That is all.  We knew about Todt.  He was traced to England in 1963 when he visited your father.  We did not know of the connection until then.  But there was nothing apart from a visit to the shop.  We lost him for a while after that until we found another visit in 1972.   We suspected that there were more, but had no proof.  Your authorities are not always so helpful. Then we heard from Zollman that your father had died and that he was contacting you.  That is where I came in.  You have given me the best break we have had.”	“Why all this, and the lovey-dovey?”  Matthew pointed at the curtains and the TV.	“We think you are being watched.”	So it wasn’t paranoia.	“Me?”	“Todt trusted your father, but he didn’t know what you might find.”	“So he knows about the book.”	“He doesn’t care about that and one old Jew.  It’s what else you may find that concerns him.  He can’t take the chance that your father had left you a letter, or something.”	“In a way, he did. The safe. Unless he had forgotten what was in it.  Those lists are over forty years old.	“But to Todt they are still dangerous.”	“Now what?”	“I’ll come back with you and get the lists, and then you are out of it, and so is your father.”	Matthew nodded.	“You can have them.”	Marion smiled and squeezed his hand.	“Thank you, Matthew.” she said.	“Why hasn’t Todt come to see if there was anything?”	“I don’t know.  Look, I must go.  I’ll call you.”	“But…”	“I have to see people, Matthew, this is more than personal.”	She got up and straightened her skirt.	“Take care, I”ll call you soon.”		The door closed softly behind her.  He sat for a moment and then drew the curtains.  Perhaps he would go out tonight.  After all, there was no point in sitting in and brooding, was there?								 	           			January 9 th. Evening, and 10th. 1989.				 			Despite his earlier decision to go out Matthew decided to have a drink and try to think everything through in some sort of order.  He lay back on the bed and sipped at the glass of gin and orange he had ordered from the hotel bar.	“Probably cost more than a whole bottle, but what the hell,” he said to the room as he starred at the ceiling and tried to see how what he knew fitted with what he had learnt.	Most of it appeared to make some sort of sense.  Old friends stayed in touch and an old Jew persued a dream which, once the book was released to him, could be part fulfilled.  It may also go a little way to mitigating any guilt attached to his father in that particular area.  What was difficult was why a man who fought against Germany would then be a willing helper to re-establish Nazism?  Did friendship go that far?  Perhaps that sort of friendship did.  Would he do that for a woman?  He could not help thinking of Marion, and then of Jenny.  He looked at his watch; she may still be at the shop.  He picked up the phone.  It rang a long time, but he was loath to hang up.	“Vigor Antiquarian Books.”	“Jenny, its Matthew.”	“Where are you?”  She sounded pleased to hear him.	“At the hotel.”	“When are you coming back?”	“Tomorrow.  Why do you miss me?”  He nearly hadn’t said that.	“Yes.  Oh, the police called.  They want you to ring them.”	“Did they say what about?” His stomach turned over.	“No, but they didn’t sound as if it mattered.  They said when you got back was fine.”	Probably about the attempted break in.  If it was to do with Julien, surely they would be more concerned.	“Any other news?”	“Not really. The cats fine, so’s the shop and there was a message for you to call a Mr.XXX”	Now what, damn Susan and all solicitors, he thought.  “That’s not urgent either.  Well, see you tomorrow, then.”	“Take care, Matthew, bye.”  	He put the phone back on the cradle. 	She was a funny one, cool and cold and nothing in between.  He was still thinking about Jenny when the phone rang.	“Hallo.”	“Matthew Vigor?”	“Yes.”	“I am a friend of your father’s, a very old friend, and I think that we should meet.”	The English was perfect, perhaps, too perfect.	“I am sure you know my name, but I would prefer it if you did not say it over the phone.”	“Yes,” said Matthew.	“Do you have a map of the city?”	“Yes.”  he had picked it up in the museum yesterday.	“Please get it and open it and put your finger on Dam Square.”	Matthew did so.	“Now find Houckgeest and then go along it until you come to Luiken.  You have that?”	“Yes.”	“Do you see Hoeraachtige.  It’s a small alley.”	“Yes.”	“On that corner is a club, The Willful Woman.   Go in as if you had come to see the show, put your paper on the desk.  When you take out your money, you will be given a ticket.  Go and sit in the back row on the end seat, it will be vacant.”	“When?”	“You are not busy.”	“No.”	“Then now is a good time, and Matthew, bring the copy of today’s Guardian with you, the one from the lobby.”	The connection was broken and he returned the phone.	That had to be Ernst Todt.  What was he doing here?  More to the point, why?  He also knew that the hotel had the Guardian and that he knew how to get to Dam Square.  					The ‘Willful Woman’ had a tatty nondescript appearance that was in keeping with the general run down air that this section of the red light district espoused.  There were few people in the street and little traffic.  Perhaps things heated up later.	Matthew went in and put the paper on the desk.  A shadowy figure handed him a ticket and pointed toward a faded red curtain that hung where a door had once been and where they hadn’t bothered to paint over the marks left by the departed hinges.  The back end seat was empty, as was most of the small auditorium.  On stage a woman who, whatever her age, no longer looked young, whirled a whip about the bound and buttock raised man whose indignity occupied the center of the stage.  The sound effects of the whip landing were out of sink with the landing blows, but no one appeared concerned.  He sat for a while, the action unremitting in its repetitiveness; that this could arouse anyone was beyond him.  A hand touched his shoulder.	“Mr.Vigor, come with me.”	It was the man with the hat from the cafe, who liked free chocolate cake, but now was not the time to mention it.	Matthew followed him down the aisle and then through a metal door into a corridor.  They stopped before another door and Cake Man knocked softly.	“Come.”	Cake Man walked away and Matthew pushed the door open.	The room was carpeted, but bare save for a desk with a chair in front of it and a lamp that threw most of its light toward him.  Behind the desk, almost in darkness, a man stood up.	“Matthew Vigor, I am Ernst Todt.  Thank you for being so prompt and please forgive the theatricals of our meeting.”	Matthew sat in the chair and a hand tilted the light which gave him his first view of Todt.	He must be in his seventies, Matthew thought, but he didn’t look it.  In a dark grey suit, upright, with rimless glasses and greying hair, he looked like a banker.  The face was chiseled and almost without lines.  The eyes pale blue and mesmeric.	“So, the son of Maurice. No doubt you have many questions and already an opinion of me.”	“I have heard some things.”	“Ah, stories.  You were warned about stories, especially those whose truth depends on who is telling them.”	“I know my father thought you his friend.”	A faint smile touched the thin lips.	“And how do you know that?”	“His journal.”	Todt nodded.	“Maurice was a great keeper of things.  So you have read his journals.  Well they at least will tell you the truth as he knew it.”	Hands, perfect in shape and well manicured, came together on the desk.	“And what else do you have of his?”	“Don’t you know?”	“Yes, but I was hoping you would tell me.”	There  seemed little point in not.	“An old book, some papers of the work done by a man called Simms during the war and some catalogues from the shop he had in Paris.  The book and the papers are being held by the bank.”	The pale eyes locked his gaze and the silence grew.	“There were two other books in the safe,”  Matthew said at last and was rewarded with another faint smile.	“But they and the gentleman who claimed them no longer concern us, do they?”	‘No.”	“People should not make threats, it is unhealthy.”	“Why not before then?”	“How circumspect your question, and yet how much it assumes.”  Todt paused as if thinking.  “Relatively a sleeping dog, and if I may mix metaphors, why make waves until it is necessary.” 	Matthew said nothing.	“You are going to return the book to David Zollman.”	“Yes.”	“And you want to know why Maurice did not and why he kept it?  Maurice was too sentimental.  The book was both pain because of Simms’ betrayal and death and at the same time a connection with him.  As for the old man, he just didn’t like him.”	Matthew could sympathise with that.	“He told you that?”	“Not in so many words, but Maurice told me most things.”	“But you did not?”	The smile came again.	“You do not miss much Matthew.  You think quickly and I like that.”	“I am not like my father.”	“You mean you are not a homosexual,  or not a sympathiser?”	“Neither.”	“Are you sure?”	Matthew was about to speak when Todt spoke again.	“Are you sure you are not a sympathiser?  Let us see.  Returning the book has nothing to do with politics, does it? No, that is about supposed guilt.  Did you throw out the books in the shop?  Did you forbid their sale?  No, they are still there and still being sold.  Are you a member of any socialist party?  No.”  He held up his hand. “Voting Labour in Britain means nothing, I am talking about socialism.  Do you welcome the dilution of your culture by the blacks?  Do you welcome their drugs and crime on your streets?  Don’t you wish there was some real leadership in your counrty, in the west as a whole?  Be honest with yourself Matthew, you are a beliefless liberal, untried, untested and hoping someone else will clear up the mess.”	Despite the immediate anger the accusation brought, Matthew recognised the truth in Todt’s words.	“Well, there is no harm in that.  There are others who will clear up the mess.  All you have to do is not impede them.  You are thinking about the mindless clods who march about in boots and wave old Nazi flags.”  Todt shook his head.  “They are a distraction, a placebo for the conscience of democracy.”  He lent towards Matthew.  “If they were not there, not a visible and derisive focus for the anti fascist-diatribes of the left, then perhaps more dangerous and searching questions may be asked.  Of course we encourage them, but they are not us.  Remember June 1934?”	“The Night of the Long Knives.”	“Good, you know your history. How about current events?”	“I read the papers.”	“Ah yes, the great Manchester Guardian, the liberal archeype.  What are your views on Israel and Palestine?”	“They have a right to a homeland.”	“Who? The Jews who were promised it by Balfour who wanted their support in 1915, or the Arabs who both lived and fought there?”	“You are being selective.”	“And who is not?”	Todt sat back and then stood up.  He was a good six feet and looked trim.  He came round to the edge of the desk and sat half against it.	“Matthew, you are the son of my old friend and I want you to do something for me.  Before I ask I will tell you this.  Your father was a good man.  He was caught and swept up by the currents of his time; he was not a maker of currents, few are.  But like many in England, he saw the evils of communism.  Unfortunately, skillful and interested proaganda made Germany the enemy not the Soviet Union.  Even Winston Churchill, implacable enemy that he was, saw clearly the dangers that communism represented.  Yes, Germany made a mistake, the Fuhrer was too eager, too over reaching and the Endlossen programme yielded a whirlwind that was not deserved.  Germany was to be a bulwark for the West, but mistakes were made that will not be made again.”	“Six million Jews....”	“Twenty million Russians - we play with figures, Matthew.  When history is revised, there will be a different story.”	“David Irving, or do you refer to Robert Faurisson”  	“Have you read them? Have you read the Marxist East German school of histories of the era.  Of their view of the war?  You should and you will find they describe a very different war to the one you are familiar with.  History is a tool, not a truth.  Just look round you at the world, senseless waste and competition where there should be direction and goals.  I have fought all my life to end communism.  For a while your father helped me and did more than he ever knew.  Sadly he will not see our harvest.   Within two years there will not be a Soviet Union.  There will be no Berlin Wall and Germany will be united again, the Cold War will be over.”	“War?”	“No, not by war, but by the victory of countless men who have risked their lives to undermine, to erode and to enlighten.  Imagine the possibilities of a world where so much money and energy is released to build for a future. Where millions now enslaved are freed to make choices.”	“They may not chose your path.”	“With help they will.”	“So Fabianism is to replace Blitzkrieg?”	“Has replaced, Matthew, has replaced.”		There was a tap on the door and Todt went over and opened it a crack.  A fast whispered conversation ensued.		“I’m sorry, Matthew,” he came back to the edge of the table, “but I have to leave in a few moments.  I would like you to destroy the catalogues and the lists you found in the safe.  I regret the fact your father kept them and that I must ask this of you.”	Matthew believed the regret.      “I know you have offered them to the young lady, however, she has  not been truthful with you.  She is not Marion Zollman, she is an Israeli agent, and I would not believe her promises.  If it suits their purpose they will bismirch his memory and make him a scapegoat for those they cannot reach.  While the lists are not now of great importance they do include the names of people who are currently in high office in Europe and the United States.  Some are also in the Soviet Union.  If this were revealed it may delay the events of which I spoke and it could make things more difficult for me.”	“Surely you could just have them taken.  Didn’t you try before?”	Todt shook his head.	“No, I prefer you do this of your own will.  You chose.  As for the attempted break in, that was not us.  Neither is it us who have followed you since your father’s death.  Perhaps that is something you should ask the young lady about.”	Todt picked up a small case that had been behind the table.	“Did you bribe my father with looted books?”	“No, I gave your father books that had come from occupied areas to sell in the shop he wanted in Paris.  They came to me almost by accident.  For your information there were two shipments.  One he sold and one, unfortunately also containing some material belonging to me that he was to take care of, was destroyed in a warehouse fire before he had time to collect it.  And now, if you will forgive me, I must go.”	He stood in front of Matthew.	“You look a lot like your father, you know.  I would like to shake your hand, but it would hurt me if you were to reject the gesture.”	Matthew could not help himself.  He stretched out his hand.  Todt shook it with a firm grip and there was a sudden warmth in the room.	“Thank you Matthew, goodbye.”		Todt left and Matthew sat down again unable to stop the shaking that took hold of his body.  After a while the emotion subsided and reason again took control.	That man is a master psychologist, he thought.  The right words to bend and shape, and yet, beyond the words was something else that he could not name.		He went along the corridor and through the auditorium where on stage a couple fucked with tired exhibitionism to a totally inappropriate waltz tune.	Outside the light was failing and garish neon began its nocturnal domination of the street.		Now he had a conscience to wrestle with where before their had been a clear and morally easy decision.  He did not like being used or being lied to, especially by a woman.	She wanted the papers to use.  Todt only wanted them destroyed.  Was there a difference?	He walked on oblivious to all but his thoughts.  The end of the Cold War?  Well if the Soviet Union ended, would that mean the end of comminism as a world force?  It certainly wouldn’t do Cuba a lot of good.  Nor any of the other satellites.  What about China?  But was that a communist country, or just China?  Did exposing Nazis now matter?  It wouldn’t bring anyone back and what did it really prove?  What about Marion, or whatever she was called.  Would she drag his father out of the obscurity he had obviously preferred?	“Oh damn it!”	A passerby gave him a look and walked on.	He could talk to Jenny about it, but he was pretty sure she would not want anything that could hurt Maurice.  The simplest thing would be to destroy them.  	Back at the hotel there was a message for him to call Marion and a number.  He put it by the phone.	He made a decision.  He picked up the phone and rang the flat; he would leave a message for Jenny.  She’d see it when she came to feed OC.	The phone answered after a ring.	“Hallo?”	He recognised the voice.	“Jenny.”	“Oh Matthew, I hope you don’t mind, but I decided to stay at the flat as I was working late and..”	“I’m glad you did,” he said and wondered if she was planning to sleep in his father’s room.  “Look, I’ve changed my plans.  Since I’m here I’m going to go to Angoulime and just check it out there and then come back.  Just a couple more days.”	“Is everything alright?”	“Fine.”  He was not going to talk about Todt on the phone.  “Can you call Eddie? his number’s on the pad and get him to call the solicitor and see if there’s anything in the post he should have.  Tell him to bluff me a couple of days if anything is desperate.”	“Okay”	“Jenny, those lists - will you put them somewhere very safe?  Its important.”	“Will do.  Tell me about it later.”	“Sure, bye.”	He hung up.  That was the best thing about her - she didn’t ask too many questions.	He called the airline; they could change the ticket and he could fly back from Paris.  They must be used to business men doing this sort of thing.   He found the station number in the book.  Thank God for a sensible country where most people appeared to speak English.  There was a sleeper train to Paris and then he could take a connection to Angoulime the next morning.  He’d call Marion later.	The train pulled into the Gare du Nor with the puffing jerks typical of that mode of transport.  He pulled his case off the rack, pulled on his trousers and laced his shoes.  He’d find a hotel in Angoulime and clean up.  Till then he was a traveller.  According to the schedule the Angoulime connection left from quay 5 in, he looked at his watch, forty-five minutes.  He looked round for a cafe.  A wash he could do without, but not coffee.		He had a seat by the window and he settled back, the extra chocolate croissant still in its bag on his knee.  He would nibble that for elevenses.  The journey would take three hours.  Finally the train settled into a steady rhythm and he watched Paris glide by.  At first, the red brick buildings of the prewar era, interspersed with some new and ghastly plastic framed warehouses, and then the start of the residential area.  Firstly crowded tenements, now the homes of the pieds noir, where hope and graffiti abided in inverse relationships,  and then the new town houses with small gardens and large cars.  Slowly soft winter green took over from red brick and white concrete, the houses fewer and larger.  The trees and fields stretched lazily out into the long horizon of the market gardens and small farms that ringed the city.		Small stations took more than they gave and the train emptied.  He half-dozed and then caught the falling bagged croissant and cursed the grease stain its soujorn had left on his lap.  As punishment for its crime, he ate it and then checked that he had the name of the bank from which the monthly payments had originated en route for Paris and then London.   It wasn’t a lot to go on, but it was better than nothing, as long as Angoulime wasn’t blessed with too many bookshops and too many branches that dealt with Credit Mobilier.	The train, only three minutes late by his watch, sidled into the small station and clanked to a stop.  Matthew alighted along with more sacks and crates from the baggage car than fellow passengers.   He left the station which appeared to be on the south edge of the town and began the walk toward the spire of a church which still dominated the other buildings.  Obviously, this was not a town that attracted high rise architecture.  As he walked on he began to wonder if the town attracted very much at all.  It was old.  Not old in the sense of historic, well not as far as he had seen.  No, it was old in the way that yesterday’s dish water was old, cold, forgotten, and full of slightly decaying bits and pieces.  A thin wind scudded clouds, and hinted at probable rain.	He pulled the collar of his coat closer about his neck, glad he had brought it with him and wishing he had also brought a scarf.  The wind had a way of finding the little gaps and blowing gently, but coldly in.  He came to a cross roads and sat for a moment on a bench dedicated to a long dead mayor.  	“God, a map would help,” he muttered.	There were, so far, no shops.  The road left looked uninteresting; to the right it turned out of view, but appeared to head in the general direction of the church.  He stood up and walked on.  As he rounded the corner the whole aspect of the town changed.  An old, this time historically so, bridge swelled gracefully over a fast grey river and led upwards past the church.  He could see the front of shops.  He quickened his pace.  Beyond the church a cafe, more shops, and by the look of it, offices.  A bicycle creaked past, he called out.	“Is there a bank or a hotel nearby?”	“Not far,” the man hardly broke the rhythm of his peddling though he gestured in the direction Matthew was walking.	“Thanks,” Matthew called after him.	More a pension than a hotel, but it was open, warm, and surprisingly friendly, for France.	Obviously delighted that the Englishman could speak passable French, he was greated effusively and given all the information he desired plus a lot more.  Armed with maps, brochures of the town’s attractions, and recommendations of the best places to eat, he finally reached his room on the second floor.  A room with a bath, a radio, but no T.V., and a view of the back of the church.	Bathed, shaved, and changed into clean trousers and a shirt, he made his way downstairs conscious of the time and that banks often closed midday.	The first bank did not deal with Credit Mobilier, howeve,r the bank five doors up did.   He had about fifteen minutes before the call of lunch would halt the wheels of commerce.	The teller listened to his request.  She would see if the manager could help him.	The manager could and would.	He guided Matthew to a comfortable chair and then from his regal position behind a huge oak desk he listened, tutting symathetically at the described loss of a parent. 	Of course, he could give no details, however, they did transfer the sum Matthew mentioned to the bank in Paris and had done so for many years long even before he had been the manager.  However, the man Matthew needed to speak to was Monsieur Belmond,  the notary who made the monthly deposit.	The manager looked up at the sonorously ticking clock on the wall.  Now Monsieur Belmond would be at lunch, though not at a cafe.  He made it sound as if the notary had a secret meeting kept between twelve and two on weekdays.	“There is an excellent café.  I can recommend the fish most certainly.  Perhaps you would care to try it?”	Matthew agreed and left the office with handshakes and professions from the manager of a willingness to handle any financial transactions his sojourn at Angoulime may require.		The ambience, the fish, and the wine surpased the recommendation and Matthew, replete and hopeful made his request to see the notary to the very attractive woman in the outer office.	  		Quite how to describe M.Belmond at first taxed Matthew.  Like an avuncular friend of the family he sat behind his desk wearing a smile that indicated contentment with life and a willingness to do whatever added to the sum total of human happiness.  He was neither florid nor athletic, seeming more in transition from one to the other, though in which direction only those who had known him for some time would be able to tell.  That he was obsessed by trout fishing, however, was for all to see.  Pictures of trout, of him, of rivers and of the paraphenalia of the mystery hung on every wall.  A fly tie clamp stood on the desk surrounded by feathers, line, tweezers and sketches.  Little room was left for the mundane papers of his ascribed profession.	He listened to Matthew’s enquiry and complemented him on his French.	“I am sorry to hear of Maurice Vigor’s death,” he said, “although it was my father who conducted the original business with him.”	He did not say what the business was.	“When did this happen?” 	“Oh, 1951 or 2, I’d have to look it up to be exact.”	“The same amount of money?”   	“No, account has been taken of inflation.”	“Can you tell me what the business was?”	“I would like to, however I do not know who you are.”	Matthew  showed him his passport.	“I understand that,” he passed it back. ”And you know the details of the amounts, but I would have to see the documents of the death and a will that is acceptable under French law before I can transfer the property...” He paused as if he had let that much slip out unintended.	“My father once had a book shop in Paris before he opened his shop in London,” he said hoping for more.	“There are two bookshops in Angoulime,”  Belmond paused, “but only one has been here from before the war and was, still does to some extent, deal in old books.”	“So this money is rent?”	“Mr. Vigor, I would like to be more helpful.”	“But you need documentation.”	Belmond smiled, “With the correct papers all doors are opened to you.”	“Would you list what you require?”	“I would be happy  to.”  Again the pause.  “If I may be as open as I can, it would be to both our advantage if, how can I say, other arrangements than the current one could be made regarding the er…”	“Property.”	“Precisely.”	“It may take a while for probate to happen in England.”	“What are a few more months.  Perhaps it will be summer and then I can show you the river at its best.  Do you fish?”	“Not in rivers.”  Matthew saw himself, a child again, line and feathers to hand hauling in the gasping silver mackeral of the bay.	“Then you should, for your soul if not your stomach.”	Belmond drew paper from his drawer and scribbled.	“Papers required, address, fax number.”  	He passed the paper to Matthew.	“Thank you,” Matthew stood up.	“Enjoy your stay here.  this is a town with a history.”	The increasingly insistent wind and the grey sky did not encourage pedestrain exploration.  He would visit the church out of professional interest and then the  bookshop.  He had not forgotten Todt’s comment that he was being followed and if that were true he did not want to be any more obvious than was necessary.	He would return to Paris in the morning and fly home.	 	 											January to September 1946.     The sea was calm.  It would be an easy crossing and if the train were on time he would be in Paris by the afternoon.  Already he knew a great burden had been lifted in just  being free of that imprisoning island.  To be across that sleeve of water that held the cloak of difference over England, separating its people from their European commonality and making them proud and perfidious, was in itself a joy.     He let the wind blow his hair and pierce his skin with its refreshing and cleansing blast.   He waved at the following gull and swallowed the salt air as an elixir that would take away his sorrow and his sin.  He watched as Calais crept towards them slowly opening out to a full coastline, like an illustrated concertina breathing out sounds and smells of a profound and welcome difference.         He went straight to the train, there would have been time for a coffee either at the station buffet, or even with haste at the edge of the town, but he would wait on Paris – it would be his present to himself.   He would let the desire build within him – wait, then indulge.  The train hissed, shuddered into life and as the last doors crashed shut they were away.      This Christmas, he thought, he would be alone.  For a dark moment he remembered the horror of the relentless pain he and Eric had suffered at each others existence in that vampire town whose liberation had  brought more agony than possession.     It would be good to be alone, to do as he pleased, to relax and  to come to terms with the boundless possibilities of a life yet to be lived.       "Not quite boundless,"  he said to himself. "Not quite boundless."  He knew he was no tabula rasa and what ever he did  now would be shaped by the past he had both contrived and permitted.  "If only we knew how much that which we do not consciously decide is eventually decided for us."  He smiled to himself at the triteness of his words.  He was glad he was alone in the compartment.  Time and the countryside rushed by unmarked as his eye looked inward and his mind reflected on the events of his life that his memory allowed him.     "That alone makes it worthwhile, that alone is enough."  He was thinking of his friendship with Ernst, of the bond which had endured and would endure because he valued it above all else and because he knew that for whatever reason, Ernst felt the same.     Fields began to give way to thickening habitations, to factories, to widening roads that tore through thinning green to grey and reds and into the city that clacked and rattled the carriage as it crossed and recrossed tracks finally slowing into the Gare du Nord and the long- awaited coffee.     To cold for the pavement, he sat by the bar. It was Christmas eve 1945 and he was free, at least for the present.       There were quite a few men in the café.  Parcelled and packaged, they drank, exchanged jokes and exclamations, and were outwardly happy.  In the street, glimpsed through the half-netted curtains, last minute shoppers rushed from their lists to their purchases and back to their lists. There was money, there were goods, and there were people to buy for.  There was also peace.       He chose a small hotel just far enough from the station not to be clogged with suspended travellers and yet to have enough guests to make communal meals interesting.  There was nothing quite as depressing as eating alone in a room for twenty or more.     A bed, a table, a chair, a wardrobe, no different to the hotel in Victoria in furnishing, but a whole world away in ambience.  The sound and smells that insinuated themselves into the room spoke of possibilities, of excitement, of what might be.        An accordian was playing across the road.  He opened the window to the cold and the traffic and the music and he let his Englishness bleed into the Parisian night.     He did not call the number Ernst had given him, he wanted the aloneness of this Christmas for himself; he would call on the 27th and then let the external world back in.  He drank a little wine, reread some Verlaine and Beaudelaire, ate and enjoyed Madame Serandour's excellent cooking and slept like a man unpossesed.  On the 27th, he called the Trocadero number.     By the third, he was established in the upper floor of the ex-leather goods and saddlery shop in the Rue dela Chat Qui Peche.  There was a tiny kitchen, a bathroom and a room that made pretence at both day and night convenience.  He settled for a bedroom and would use the empty barn-like room below as a day office and sitting room.  The ground floor would be the shop.      Two days later the books and shelves arrived.  Maurice watched his shop take shape with an indulgent eye and a generosity of spirit that was not taken advantage of by the carpenters who saw in him a visionary manque as he broached the shelf cases with the joyful innocence of one come suddenly among great treasure.          It was for Maurice the time of the greatest joy, to place the books on the shelves, to compile the lists of their being and their values, to cross-reference.  It was with a father's pride that he showed the finished unity to Ernst when on the 12th he called to see his friend.     "Now it is my turn to give papers."  He said handing residence and business permit forms to Maurice.  "And I must compliment you on the excellence of the 'Magazin Antiquarian Vigor'.  But now we must talk of other things."  And he went with Maurice to the second floor.       "What are you planning with this room?"     "An office and a sitting area,"  Maurice gestured with his hand mapping the space.     "Excellent."  Ernst nodded, "Excellent.  In that corner, back from the window, but well lit there could be a long table for those days when our friends need to meet."     Maurice understood.  Our friends, he thought, for even if I am no activist I will serve for Ernst at least.     "I will have one sent along, and I think you could use some 'a few sticks of furniture', let me see what you need."     Ernst went upstairs and he and Maurice planned the necessary accouterments of a simple, but comfortable home.     "Certainly a bed.  It is no longer war that you should sleep on the floor."     Maurice had not minded.  The building was warm, he had cushions, but despite his protestations Ernst's list grew longer.     "Don't worry about it.  I have friends who are moving; there is more furniture than they will need.  Take it just until you get your own."     And so it was done.  Ernst went and within hours the furniture arrived with men to carry and to place it at Maurice's command.  Whatever else thought Maurice, Ernst got things done.  Ernst, without doubt, had good contacts and powerful friends.      Later that evening Ernst returned with champagne and glasses.  They sat, Ernst insisted, at either end of the long table with the unused chairs against the wood.     "Two toasts, my friend.  One to those who did not make it."  Ernst sipped from the glass and saluted with it to the sloping chairs.  Maurice thought of Eric, his grandparents, the soldier, and of Lilly.       "The second is to your excellent bookshop.  May you, it, and all who come here prosper."     They finished the bottle and spent the rest of a long and most enjoyable evening remembering times before the war and filling in those gaps during the war.             The next morning Maurice opened the shop.  One advert had been placed in the leading bibliophilic magazine in each country - Ernst had seen to that.  Word of mouth would do the rest in time.  Maurice was in no rush.  He had stock enough now, no expenses, and over two hundred pounds to cover any emergencies.      The books Ernst had given him were worth many times over the amount he had paid to Michael Julien, and there were more books yet to come.  Maurice had already planned to pay some of his profits back to Ernst as books sold. He was quite content to only take his outlay and a fair wage.     Sitting in the quiet leather room of books that first open morning, Maurice drew paper and pen towards him from the small stack he had made on the little wooden desk in the corner of the room and he began to write.  He wrote first to his mother asking her to freight out to him the box of his own books he had left with her.  He gave her careful instructions - she was not good with such things though she did have aunt Lara to help her.  He enclosed more than enough money to cover the cost and told her to buy something for herself, 'should there be any change'.     He also wrote to the old bookseller in Angoulime who had taught him so much.  He  hoped  that he had not died or sold and moved on.  He wanted him to know that his hours of instruction were now bearing fruit.  It was to be some weeks before he had a reply.  The old man was still there, happy to hear his news, and to send on the books he had left together with the yellow oilskin parcel.  So  began their monthly bookish correspondence.      Maurice also began to read through some book auction catalogues he had picked up.  Stock would need to be replenished and he also must augment his rather expensive tomes with some that would be more affordable to the small collector.  Few men can begin with rarities, unless of course they are rich or lucky.       The door opened.  He must fit a bell he thought as he watched the man enter.  He seemed uncertain at first and hovered near the door.     "Please feel free to browse."  said Maurice and returned to his catalogue.     The man, in his middle years to judge by his face, though older if his grey hair were to be the arbiter of age, relaxed and began to slowly look along the shelves, now and then withdrawing  a book and then replacing it.  Engrossed in his reading, Maurice forgot the man was there until he became conscious of him standing not far from the desk with a hesitancy that required encouragement.     "May I help you?"  Maurice asked.     "You have not been here for long?"     "No, this is the first day that I am open."  replied  Maurice, his words as formal as the man's.                           "You are not French."       "I am English."       "I am Hungarian."  came the reply.  "We have all come a long way to be here."     "That is true."  Maurice knew the man wanted to say more, but was holding back.     "Do you have a mailing list."     "Not at present, but I shall do so."     "Perhaps you could add my name to it when you do?"     "What is your special interest?"  Maurice drew a sheet of paper towards him.     "Politics," There was a hesitation, "Geography and race."     "I see."  Maurice looked at him.  "Were you notified of the shop opening?"     "A friend told me there was a new bookshop that might have what I was looking for."     "I am sure he was right."       The man smiled and passed him a card with a name and address.     "I would like to know if any books or other collectors are..."     "About?"  finished Maurice.     The man nodded.     "I will be sure to let you know."       "I am grateful to you."  He bent his head slightly at Maurice in a way reminiscent of Ernst and he left the shop.     Maurice looked at the card and then at the empty shop.       "So, you are the first."  He put the card into his drawer.  He must find a safe place for these, he thought, and he would ask Ernst's opinion when they met again.     So began the pattern for the next month - genuine book buyers mixed with those seeking to be placed on the mailing list.  Maurice closed the shop one afternoon and went to an auction returning with a most serendipitous collection of second hand titles.  It appeared that this was indeed the time to be buying, for in post-war Paris there were many who were short of cash and were willing to see treasured possessions go to ease their difficulties.  Maurice bought much and sold little.  Still, he had most of his reserve money to hand and his outgoings were small.  He admitted to his journal that he was at last happy, though lonely for a companion, for someone to share the mundane and the ordinary and to be there at the end of the day.       In mid-February Ernst again appeared without notice.     "It will soon be time to hold a meeting of book enthusiasts."  he said looking over the list.  "I suggest that you hide these names in the most obvious place.  Why not a list of catalogue subscribers?  Use the phone book if you need and collate these names into it in an order only you will know.  Use some numerical system, birthdays, old telephone numbers, what ever you like."     He pulled a chair up to the small desk and opened his briefcase.      "This printer will make up your catalogues from the titles you give him.  Here are a list of books to be included on certain pages that will correspond to the dates of meetings that will be held here.  The cover is simple, they will all be bibliophiles, no longer book burners, and they will be attending periodic collector 'get togethers' to discuss the progress of their collections."     "Should I be present?"  Maurice was not sure of his position.     "That is up to you, my friend.  Do as you wish, just let them in and let them have the room upstairs.  You are already performing an invaluable service."     "Will you be coming?"     "To some and not to others."       Ernst pulled out some packages and letters.  "These are to be posted from different parts of the city.  You will receive others that are to be held until they are called for.  This list gives you the means to identify them and the correct callers."     He looked at Maurice carefully.  "Are you still happy to be involved?"     Maurice nodded.       "Then let us go from strength to strength.  There is much damage to repair and, with the trials to come, some very bad publicity, I think.  The Zionists will do all they can to make capital of our defeat and I fear they will not always adhere to the truth.  It is a very emotive issue and the waters are, as you say, much muddied."     Ernst shut his case.     "Come, let us go out and eat and you can tell me how business is doing."     As the months passed, Maurice tended the precious list of the newly hatched Phoenix members who spanned the continent of Western Europe.  From his small bookshop in the Ninth Arrondisement, the web of 'collectors' grew putting down their thin, but determined roots into the very core of the post-war democracies.  Now and again a name or a face was familiar to him.  Politicians, industrialists, judges and even men known by past military success appeared to subscribe to his catalogues.  He sent parcels to Ireland, England, Scandinavia, Holland, France, Italy, and Spain.  Only Germany did not feature in the list and Maurice presumed that Ernst was taking care of that directly.       The constant stream of newspapers revelations and atrocity stories did make Maurice wonder about the true nature of the recent events in occupied Europe and of the exact purpose of the Phoenix group as he had come to call them.  But whatever doubts he had, he did not broach them with Ernst or with anyone else.  He knew that it is always the victor that writes history and that history is whatever it is said to be.  Evidence and 'fact' can be read in many different ways and truth was, as he knew from personal experience, a very slippery eel.  However hard he tried, he could never believe in an absolute with regard to human beings.  He knew there was good, bad and evil, but never unalloyed - each was always tempered with some of the other.       Despite his intellectualising, as he called it, over his doubts, there was a much easier explanation of why he asked nothing and thought as little as possible about the purpose and intent of the Phoenix.  He just did not really want to know.      If he did not know, he could only ever accuse himself of culpable ignorance.  Anyway what could they do that would be harmful?  He agreed with all efforts to contain and to even destroy communism and  he had no love of Zionists.  What he had seen of the early days of Nazi Germany had been more attractive than repulsive.   It was also possible that some people had gone too far, intoxicated with power and an ideal. It was also possible, as Ernst suggested, that these revelations were the lies of the victors.  Films and photographs could be faked, as could witnesses.  And the blacker the old enemy appeared, the whiter the winners. Even those who had in their will to win, had done much to be ashamed of.       Maurice remembered George saying something about an island off Scotland so contaminated with anthrax as to be uninhabitable for hundreds of years.  It had been a testing ground for germ warfare against the enemy.  He had also seen some films of the results of the fire bombing of German cities.  He knew that they had not been, and probably would never be, openly available.  And then there was the Atom bomb.     If Ernst had a dream, it was not in itself a bad dream and it gave Maurice a bookshop and a purpose.  He was happy.  Happy to be part of the dream of a God who loved him.     "Those who are not for me are against me; those who do not gather, scatter."     He couldn't remember the chapter and verse, or even the book.  But he would sooner gather and support and that was that.   He heaved the next box of books from the floor and began to carry it upstairs to the main room.     "Gather, gather, gather."  He puffed to the top.     Then down again for the next box.  He had bought most of the stock from the widow of a bookseller who had much dross, but some gems, for a ridiculous price.  Now he was moving the best and most expensive of the Lutz books upstairs for the real specialists and beginning to rearrange the downstairs shelves to attract and to satisfy the more average buyer who he felt had previously been a little intimidated.  The longer he sold books the better he was becoming at it and the more it satisfied something deep within him.     "Sans Ernst rien."  he chanted to himself as he contined the labours of Hercules late into that night, by the next morning he was rearranged and open and tired.        The first real meeting of the Phoenix group was scheduled for the end of the month.  There had been a couple of preliminary sessions which Ernst had arranged and for which Maurice had made coffee, but he had then stayed downstairs to keep an eye on the shop.  This, however, was to be an evening meeting and he would be able to stay throughout the whole session.   He had to admit to himself he was curious as to the agenda.  And to the faces that fit at least some of the names and addresses in his book.      Maurice stood by the door.  He had put out the glasses and laid out the name tags as Ernst had instructed.  Now all he could do was wait.  He had previously been  down stairs leaving only sufficient light to guide those unfamiliar with the shop.  The street light outside and at the corner were unlit, their bulbs broken earlier in the day.  There was no moon tonight and the darkness wrapped itself about the tiny street shrouding any who slipped into the shop door from prying eyes or camera lenses.         "That anyone should know, or watch, is very unlikely," Ernst had said,  “But act on the unlikely, think the impossible, and maintain the anonymity of our group for as long as possible."     One by one he had greeted and guided the men who came carefully up the stairs to the long table and their seat.  They sat now like bankers or undertakers in their dark suits with somber heavy faces and brittle careful eyes.  None spoke, nor did they look about and the air became thick with their distrust and expectation.  From his vantage point Maurice could see ten faces and ten backs.  The chair at the head of the table was for Ernst and it was for Ernst that all now waited.        "Gentlemen, good evening."  He had come down from the upper room unseen and now stood just into the pool of light before walking to the table.     Chairs scraped as the twenty stood and twenty arms went up.  Ernst's almost casual return together with the slight dip of his head gave immediate indication of his rank; their absolute silence confirmed it.     "Be seated."  A hand signal to Maurice who brought the bottles to the table.     "Please fill your glasses for a toast and do not look so glum."  He raised his drink, "There are nine hundred and eighty eight years still to come, the sooner we get to work, the sooner we can all enjoy them."  He stood again and they followed,  "This time by stealth."       "By stealth."  They echoed their beliefs, the words binding them tighter and tighter in the chioruscured room.  They sat, their heads turned toward Ernst. The leader, the inspiration.     "When there are too few," Ernst looked round the table,  "Even if millions, because there are more millions against us, then force is not the way."  He paused.  "Defeat does not mean either that we were wrong, or that we are finished."  His words sunk through the silence and were absorbed as irrevocably as a body is absorbed into a quick mud.     "Now our task is to create the millions that will accept our ideals because they will believe them to be right.  This way is not fast - nor glorious, but it is sure and it is simple.  The torch has passed into our hands and we shall light the way for our friends, and blind with certain fire, those who are our enemies."     He paused and sipped his wine.  His voice was soft yet it filled the room and the minds of his listeners with its absoluteness.     "From this moment, if we meet a man who is at heart one of us, or is not against us and can become one of us, then support him.  Advance him in every walk of life that he desires and in which you have influence.  Recommend him to others, ensure he prospers.  If he falls, pick him up.   If he is sick, heal him.  If he is besmirched, clean him.  Bring him slowly, but totally into his own enlightenment that one day he will do the same for another.  By this way we shall grow."     Heads nodded.     "If however, someone is against us, then block his every move, in little ways as well as large for the cumulative effect will be the same.  Obstruct and smear, but do it invisibly, always appear fair, open and democratic, but destroy him.  Should you meet someone who is beyond your power, then there are others who can be called upon to help.  In this way our enemies shall diminish."     Again the heads nodded.     "As for the masses who cannot be other than pawns in this world, then let us ensure that they are our pawns.  Remember that as long as they have enough to eat, work to do and rewarding play, they are content.  We, will come to control the means of creating taste, own the cinemas, the newspapers and the radios and tell them they have enough and that they are happy.  In this way they, too, shall believe.     Ernst steepled his fingers and looked around the table.     "As for those who are not fit, whose presence diminishes the world, then they shall be culled.  No animal permits the diseased or the crippled to breed weakness and we must remember that we, too, are animals."  Ernst smiled,  "But we are thinking animals and can select and improve our our stock.  That which is superior shall be elevated, that which is inferior shall be eliminated."  There was a long pause before he spoke again.  " Life is a struggle and from this struggle shall come the best of our species to take their just place in a world were all the plants and animals that have survived so far have done so because they are the best of their species."     He stood up, there were tiny beads of sweet on his brow and his face had taken on a little colour.     "There is not enough room on this world for the dirty, the degenerate, and the culturally inferior.  They are not even capable of enhancement, they are capable only of dragging themselves and others to a lower and lower level.  They multiply, they destroy, they contaminate and it is our duty to stop them."     His voice had risen only a little, yet it blew like a great gale through his listeners and it chilled Maurice to the spot with a mixture of fear and the memory of Lise.     "Imagine."       Ernst sat down, his body relaxed, his tone now like a deep cathedral bell that pulses in the chest of believers.     "Imagine a world where there are less people and fewer races.  Where all are of a like mind, where there is plenty for all without the destruction of our seas and forests.  Imagine this world, a world where all shall be worthy of inheritance.  We shall conquer disease, expand our knowledge beyond the wildest dreams of science and philosophy and so become the  guardians of the final order of man."     As one, the men at the table rose.  They flung out their arms and their whispered 'heils' roared out as a sea crashing across rocks and devouring vast beaches of sand.        Maurice heard his voice joining theirs, as tears coursed down his face.  He knew he had heard the voice of God speak to him through the mouth of his friend.        October 1946 to April 1947.                         In the months that followed the first meeting of the Phoenix group, Maurice set to reading some of the basic texts and authors of what he thought of as the 'Kampfziet School.'  He had a copy of Gobineau Sur L'Inequalitie de la Race Humaine' in the shop.  He found it interesting if a little dusty in places.  Houston Stewart Chamberlain was strident and Rosenberg unintelligible.  Hofstadter on geopolitics was provocative, but more to his taste was Spencer and his social Darwinism.  He found Mein Kampf tedious and egoistic, he talked to Ernst about it.     "If you want an analogy, I would suggest that you might see him as a John the Baptist who thought he was Christ."  He laughed without humour.  "With the attendant disaster."      Ernst was silent for a moment.      "Some of us thought he was the one for awhile, but he has only brought discredit on the ideal of purity and struggle.  If you really want to see where the rot began, then you must go back to the birth of Liberalism in the nineteenth century.  From that misbegotten egalitarian bastardardy has come the full evil of communism."      He walked to the window and stared out into the street.  He turned back to Maurice.  "I supported National Socialism because it believed in purity and struggle and was anti-communist.  It turned out to be also corrupt, petty, grossly inefficient, and a vehicle for megalomania.  Now we must start again out of the ashes of cities and dreams because if there is to be any hope for mankind and for the world as a living thing of which we are part, then we must tread the true path.  Purity and struggle, that is the path of evolution and history.  Read your anthropologists, read your biologists, read your historians."     And Maurice did read.  He read and he learnt as he had never done before and he was exhilarated to see the path that Ernst had pointed out.       The only progress the world saw came from struggle: men with men, men with the environment.  Where there was only acceptance, as the Aboriginal in Australia, there was nothing for ten thousand years.  Where caste locked change as in India, or habit froze behaviour as in Mandarin China, thought and responsibility were stultified.  Where religion taught the beatitudination of the poor and meek, a ruling theocracy corrupted the  message and grew fat among poverty as in the church of Rome.  Wherever there was laxness, then the base and the counterfeit grew and forced out the pure coinage as Gresham knew only too well.        However he looked at it, he saw the same pattern: if men evolved at about the same time which most authorities agreed they did, then those most fitted would have come the furthest.  How far had Africa come?  Or the indigenous races in South America?  Or any who were not Anglo-Saxon or West European?       Ernst was right.  If you presented the information as it was, then it was natural, obvious and irrefutable and everyday you could see examples of its truth before your very eyes.     At last Maurice had a weltanshauang in which his belief in strength and domination not only fitted, but was explained and justified.  He realised that the central epiphany of his life had taken place at that first meeting of the group of which he was the 'keeper of names'.       Now Maurice knew that there was and could be no greater joy in life than becoming part of the purpose of the 'one'.  And how simple it all was.  The truth was everywhere, revealed in writings, shown in the lives of men, built upon the face of the planet itself.  All you had to do to see it was to open your eyes.  That was the role and task of men like Ernst, to open eyes, to teach others to do the same until all the eyes were open and all that was seen to be wrong could be swept away.      The next few meetings of the group were more mundane.  There was the actual business of finance, infiltration, protection and enhancement of colleagues to consider.  Those coming to the upper room of the shop varied as numbers grew and soon only section and area leaders came to discuss and coordinate.  The trials and deaths of old comrades, far from damaging the resolve of members, seemed only to strengthen their conviction.  If they did not build the invisible wall to hold the evils of the east and then squeeze it to death,  then all that was right would be driven from the face of the earth.  Oh how mighty were the weak in the shadow of the victory of greater resources.     During those first months Maurice went about his twin businesses as an acolite in a state of grace.  He gained praise from Ernst and profit from his shop.  Then, as time passed, the revelation became ordinary and commonplace, but in doing so lost none of its power of truth.  Now it was just taken for granted, neither thought about, nor pursued further.  It was the bedrock of his life and opinion.     By the late autumn of 1946, Maurice felt himself moving on from what he described in his journal as the monastic stage of his life.  He was beginning to notice attractive people on the street and to feel an emptiness in his physical life.  In the evenings when he was not working, he took to visiting clubs and cabarets in the latin quarter where he could eat cheaply, drink slowly, and watch longingly.  It was here in the Club Neant that he met Claude.     Claude was from the Pyrennes.  He was five years older than him, he had a dark haunted and haunting face, deep set brown eyes and he played the saxophone in the band.  He also had the most beautiful arms and hands Maurice had ever seen.  Night after night Maurice came to listen to the music.  Both men were carried away by the sounds, one by making them the other by listening      One evening a few days before his birthday Maurice was sitting at the table when Claude sat down at the break.  Placing his arms flat on the table from elbow to wrist and drumming his fingers asked,  "What can I play for you next?"     "I'm sorry?"  said Maurice caught by the reality of the man sitting before him.     "You are my most visible fan.  What can I play for you?"     Embarrassed, Maurice rose to go.  "Nothing, I'm sorry.."     Claude took his arm.  "No. I'm sorry, but you do like my music."     "Yes, yes, of course I do."     Then drink with me and I shall play something just for you."     "Pernod."  said Maurice who had only recently discovered the liberating effects of that particular spirit.  "And play ‘Dark Eyes’."     "You are a man after my own heart.  What do you do?"     "I'm a bookseller."     "Wonderful.  You must marry my sister, she needs a man like you."     Both men broke into fits of irrepressible laughter, and so their friendship was born.      Claude had been in the Marquis in the northeast, though he came originally from the Pyrennes near Bayonne.  He was still involved with those who wanted to settle old scores with suspected collaborators and he occassionally told Maurice of the trials and executions that were carried out by these just men.     "It’s mainly the communists.  There is no way they ever forget, and I must admit they did both risk the most and lose the most."     "You are not communist?"  Maurice wanted to be sure.     "All my family are Catholic."  He spread his hands in mute eloquence.     "But why, now, it is over."     "It is not over.  It will never be over for some people."     "Is it over for you?"     "Oof. No more talk of this.  Drink.  I will tell you about my beautiful and sad sister and you will tell me about your books."     The rest of that evening and many of the evenings to follow were relaxing and rewarding, and  although still alone, he felt less lonely.     Books, meetings of the group, the club, a short Christmas spent with his mother and aunt Laura - never to be repeated - and more books took Maurice well into the new year.       A sad letter from his antiquarian mentor in Angoulime took him for a visit to see for himself the failing health of the old man who still refused to give up his profession.     "If I stop this I have nothing and then I will die."     Unable to dissuade him from his opinion, Maurice stayed until he was back on his feet, traded some titles, and gained a contact in the United States whom the old man felt Maurice could now better serve than he and Maurice then returned to Paris.     For reasons of both business and mood, Maurice did not go back to the Neant until early March only to find Claude was no longer playing there. The usually loquatious bartender was vague as to Claude's  current whereabouts.      "I heard he'd gone back home."     "Do you have an address?" Maurice desperately wanted to see him.  To know Claude was there and could be dropped in on as the mood took him had previously removed any urgency from seeing the man he now thought of as a friend.  "Are you sure he left no message for me?"   Neither message, nor address left Maurice feeling profoundly depressed and abandoned.  He knew the group needed him.  He believed that he was doing something important for the future, yet often he still felt an outsider to life itself.  Ernst was his only link to the rest of humanity.    For awhile, the slow deep ache of Eric's betrayal and rejection  returned to twist another notch deep within him.  Was there no one in the world for him?  No one who would close the gap in his being?  No one to pull the ragged edges of his feeling of separation together?      If only Ernst had more time. But Maurice knew that Ernst's role in the world did not allow him that time and Maurice accepted this as he always had.  He also felt that remaining too long or too close to so bright a sun would fry him like an over eager moth. Not that such a brief intensity before oblivion did not have its own attraction.  But it was not to be, nor was it to be overtly desired, so Maurice drove the thoughts from his mind and returned to his shop.     Despite the many problems of post-war Europe, his carefully worded and tempting catalogues brought many enquiries after books.  His stock, compared to other booksellers, was richer and more rare.  He sold well upstairs, and, he sold well downstairs where his long reading table attracted the young who bought his books as well as drank his coffee.  His textbooks, essential to the serious student sold well.  These were replenished through a contact in publishing, a friend of a friend, he told those who asked. In mid-April, another crate of books arrived from Berlin and three more in May, closely followed by an unexpected and unannounced visit from Ernst.     "We have problems."  He threw himself into the arm chair with an air of irritation more than of real concern.  He refused the offered drink.  "Nothing that cannot be dealt with.  However, it is annoying and requires certain plans to be altered."     Maurice waited knowing he would be told.  Ernst stared up at the ceiling for some time. Maurice went back down into the shop.  Closing earlier than usual for lunch he returned upstairs.  Ernst looked thoughtful and sat at the table with him picking at the cheese and bread he'd put out for them.  This time the proffered coffee was accepted.     "The books have arrived?"     Maurice said they had pointing to the boxes in the corner.     "They are nearly the last of the old stock.  Lutz has still has six boxes from a different, but similar source.  They are yours too."     Maurice nodded, then spoke quietly not wanting to offend.     "There's more than enough money now.  Please, you must have it."     Ernst shook his head.  "I, we have more than enough.  You must keep it all. Who knows, one day it will be useful to you.  Will you take the last of the books?"  Ernst paused. “There is also a small package I would like you to keep for me.  Just old memories. I will not need it but, ...”     Maurice nodded again. "If you wish."     "Good, here or somewhere else?"     "I don't know.  I will find somewhere, store them for a while.  And then..?"     "Write to Lutz, you have the address.  They can be sent where you like.  But soon, they must vanish.  There will be no more meetings here, at least for a while.  Is the list safe?"     "Yes."     "Then I'll take a copy with me."     "Will you be gone long?"     "You are perceptive as ever, old friend.  Yes, for awhile, there is a need for me elsewhere, but I will return."     "Can you tell me the problem?"     Maurice did not relish ignorance and abandonment.     "The less I tell you the better - for you."  Ernst added quickly.  "The English will soon abandon Palestine.  Once that struggle is over, certain people will begin to look very hard for certain other people.  I want a cold trail."  He saw Maurice's concern.  "You will be safe, and so will I.  We must not jeopardize the long term for want of appropriate caution.  Be careful of ..."  He did not finish the sentence.  He stood up.  "Just be careful.  I will find you wherever you go, or stay."  He held out his hand.  "Your struggle is not in the front line.  You have already done more for us than you can ever know."     When Ernst had gone Maurice sat for a long time.  It was difficult, he thought, to accept that the role of a bit player was all you would ever have.  Perhaps, one had to be born in another place if not in a different time to be able to take center stage.  Or perhaps one had just to be a different person. He had always walked close to the wall and in the shadows.  In his heart he knew he could never change that.  He was no leader and no hero.       That night, filled with a peculiar self -oathing and disgust, he got very drunk after having first masterbated himself sore and empty of all seed and emotion.     He wrote to Angoulime.  Would he store some books for him that he did not want for awhile?  The reply was telegraphed and brief.     'Sick.  Come if you can.  We help each other.'     Maurice left the shop and was there by late that night.  The old man was greyer and smaller than he had been only months before.  Something was eating him from the inside, hollowing him out and stretching the thin skin like a worn parchment over the brittling bones.     "I want to go south to die."  He spoke without preamble after holding Maurice close to him for a moment.  It was like being hugged by an autumn leaf.     "I have some money, but not enough.  Can you buy my shop?"     "Yes."  said Maurice without need of thought.  "Yes, I can for whatever you need."       Could Ernst also see the future, he wondered?     "Then we will call the notary in the morning and I can go at last."     "Do you have somewhere."  Maurice fought with tears that rose unbidden.     "I have already arranged a hospice and my grave.  There is good comfort knowing where you will rest forever."          They travelled slowly south together to the rambling white house that clung to the rocks and looked out over the blue of the Mediterranean.  A hot wind blew over the scrub and seared the bent olive trees that came up to the wall of the shaded garden.  In the brightness of the midday sun, the white clothed nurses of that ancient caring order appeared as collecting angels. Their soft skinned faces glowed and their eyes were filled with the understanding of pain and the burden of living.  There was nothing now for either man to do save for what had to be done.  One would leave and the other would die.  Both seemed to be the right and only thing there was for them to do.      Five weeks later Maurice received a letter.  All the little money he had given for the shop and some that had remained from the old man's savings had been left to him.  He wrote back; they were to keep the money for their work and to tend the grave, one day he might wish to make the same journey.          They sent him blessings and a small Byzantine picture of the passion on the cross.  He put the letter and the picture in the desk drawer - their belief and the old man's peace was not as yet for him.  However, had he been his father he could not have grieved more.       Within a week of his return from the south, four crates of books arrived at Anqoulime.   Maurice walled them in their sealed crates into the small side cellar of the shop heaving the wine rack in front of his less than expert, but serviceable brickwork.  He had worked all that weekend to ensure he alone knew where they were and to disguise their resting place.  It pleased him to admit he had made a good job of it.      The young couple, an ex-prisoner bearing the limp and the burns of the war with quiet placidity and his heavily pregnant wife  arrived with furniture two weeks later.  They would make it their home and manage the shop for him.  Maurice would return to Paris secure in mind and in legal documentation, that he had made a good choice from the many applications he had received for the position.     It surprised him how much simple paper work had accumulated during the time his efforts had been focused on the Angoulime shop.  He would also have to return to Angoulime.  There had been six boxes but somehow two of them had ended up at a warehouse near the Gare de l’Est; they would have to be collected and hidden with their bretheren.  There were letters to answer, book requests to send off, and a whole catalogue to revise which had returned from the printers. With it was a note thanking him for the phone call and appreciating that he would not want stock already sold to appear again.  He puzzled over that for a moment and then realised that Ernst must have made the call to forestall any notice of meetings which would now not take place.     However, within a couple of days he had made good headway on catching up and was once again ferreting out requests for customers and checking on those who came, usually by recommendation, to view the upstairs stock.  Of such customers, the Americans were by far the best.  They paid any price without question, knew usually what they would like, but were often happy to be advised.  All were delighted to find that Maurice spoke such good English and were indifferent to a book's 'origin' as long as an interesting provenance could be suggested to them.      And so the summer passed into autumn with the shop continuing to sell well and the small income from the Angoulime shop also flowing into Maurice's account. The only loss being the two misdirected crates at the warehouse which had perished in a fire that consumed the warehouse and the paint store nextdoor.  He made a note to tell Ernst of this.  Payments in dollars were, of course, kept separately and appeared on no books.  Otherwise Maurice did not bend the law or avoid the payment of taxes any more than anyone else.  Being a resident alien he was occassionaly visited by the police. But relations were good and he kept them that way.  There was always coffee and a place out of the rain or the sun, and an ear to listen to their problems.      Maurice found his life settling into a quiet pattern which brought him surprising contentment.  The bookshop filled his days and often his evenings. He expanded his nineteenth century collection to include European authors and he began a monograph on bookplates, the latter destined for an esoteric and occasional publication that dealt with collectabilia.  He was, although he did not recognise it as such, basically happy.       He sent money to his mother and enjoyed the security that sufficient wealth brought in its train.  He was, however, still lonely although he made no attempt to cultivate friends.  He had, as he wrote in his journal, many aquaintances both in the trade and in the clubs that he had taken once again to visiting.  He knew in the back of his mind that he still hoped one day to walk into a bar or revue and hear Claude playing those long and mournful pieces that had once so caught him.  But this hope stayed unrequited.     He heard nothing from Ernst nor from any others he knew to be of the group.  And so the list remained hidden and unchanged to as the Cold War and the cold winter tightened its grip on a Europe still thin and weak from conflict.  As the evenings darkened earlier and the nights lengthened, his loneliness grew again to torment him. Everywhere he saw pairs walking, talking, holding hands, buying presents for each other.  While they struggled together to renew their war interrupted lives, he stood as the onlooker and the outsider.       Was this his punishment?  To be alone because he had not called out to save his friend?  He remembered only the good times now with Eric because they made the pain more real, and by that pain alone he knew he was still alive.  Each day required more effort. He opened the shop because he felt he had to - less for himself and more because he had made his promise to Ernst that he would do so and would be there when he was again required.  Why?  Why, he asked himself again and again, could he not find the reason to exist within himself, but only through the vision and the being of his now absent sustainer?       He began to drink for the early ease it gave. Then with more, he began to hate himself for his emptiness, to call himself a puppet whose strings he alone could not pull.  It had not been like this at Fenton Street, or had it?  Then there had been Eric and the war and the power of the Pass and his position.  B that there had been Ernst.  In his darkness he knew why mankind had invented God, for without a God there was nothing.  No dreams, no purpose, only the physicality of lust and the need to eat and defecate.  For a moment of brief illumination he saw his desire to dominate and to master as the twisted hope of an empty soul - a soul searching to find a purpose and a gratification beyond the banal abuse of itself, and to take a mean comfort in the knowledge that there were others even weaker and emptier.       Was this then the pyramid of being?   That those in the light found eager  followers and  whose eyes remained open to the goal even when alone,  while those gloomed and shadowed in the depths beyond the reach of constant revelation found only blind and willing victims? In vain he sought to recapture the essence he had first glimpsed when Ernst had pointed out the path and he had seen the purpose and the glory.  In vain he hunted for his will finding only weakness and a dark and bitter core that shied and cowered from the light.      Now he knew he was a hollow man and he must come to terms with it for only then could he receive the athanor to sustain himself.     He began to search his books, digging again into histories to see the lives of men and nations.   He wondered if indeed there was some law of the universe that picked up the fallen and threw down the mighty when each was at the pit and peak of their life's journey.  Perhaps it was part of the same pattern that marked the rise and fall of powers, some macrocosmic wheel that turned in its limitless journey through time and space, echoing the spinning worlds and universes that spilled out beyond the imagination of man.       Birth, life, death, that was the cycle which bound all living things.  Even the non-living must obey  creation, existence and  destruction  which was their ineluctable fate whether measured by aeons or billionths of seconds.  The more he read the more he became convinced that even in life there is little choice. So much is already decided by the physical and emotional traits our parents pass on and by our time and place of our birth.  Maurice struggled with Platonic teleology, then with the dour writers on theological predestination whose joyless world repelled and sickened him for they had no hope to offer.  He briefly turned to magic and the esoteric mysteries, but all they offered was delusion.       Maurice began to lose touch with himself slipping into a twilight world of drink, dusk and dull cold dawns.  He closed the shop in mid December.  He went out only for Pernod, wine and simple foods that he could eat without real preparation whenever he remembered to eat.  Then as the tightening winter began to clamp its freezing hand across the city he went out less and less.  He did not notice Christmas; no one called, and if they had he would not have answered. He ignored the phone and after a while it stopped ringing.  Snow fell, stayed  and silenced the January streets.  At last he ran out of alcohol and began to feel the first stirings of real hunger.  There was little left to eat and he knew he must go out into the white nightmare of the world he could not escape.  He had not found his answers, he had found nothing at all, and he looked like a corpse.        The clinking sickly empty bottles lay stupidly across the floor, blatant now in their falseness as his friends and none were prophets. He cast them aside and drew the little that was himself together.  Like a Lazarus he rose, untouched by any Christ.  He baptised himself in water and he shaved, shook and bled a little into the white cold of the sink.  Then unready as he was, he mummied up against the bitter wind and cracking the ice seal on his door he stepped out into the hard bright street.                              Slowly he took the soup in, with its thick chunks of meat and vegetables soft against his tongue and teeth. Sip by sip he ate beef and potato and carrot and turnip and savoured each in turn in the rich herb soaked stock.  He pulled the white bread into small pieces and savoured them one by one.  As he ate he smiled at the people who also ate with him.  He knew they smiled back at him as one who has chosen to return.       Afterwards he sat for a long time just looking and then he spoke to those who sat nearby about the weather until he knew he could go out again.       This time the cold was less to him and he walked more briskly with a firmer step as his purpose grew.  He sought heat and headed to the Turkish baths.     He lay back, the towel loose letting the dry heat beat about through the air and the wooden slats. It bounced off the dark brick walls to drive out the very last of the cold death inside.  He watched the old men lounge like predatory tortoises. So familiar with the heat they no longer felt it hot on their dry eyes that morsed out their lust.  He ignored their invitations and they  swayed their wrinkled necks sharing in their mutual disappointment.     He went through the steam where silent men hid in chairs or lay pummelled on the wet marbled tables by large dark men in damp soiled cotton trousers.  Now he ran with rivers sourcing from his arms and groin.  Rivers cascaded from his chest and back wetting buttocks and the back of his knees and he stood against a column watching himself running onto the floor.      He lay on a vacated table and the strong fingers squeezed and pushed his muscles with a practised hand.  He felt himself anew as the palms and fingers  took his neck,  back, arms, and trunk.  Strong hands took his legs, then turned him over to do it all again.  He let his punished body slip into a dream world where synergistic senses offered a soporific to his mind. Afterwards he lay for a long time in one of the silent chairs.       Showered and softly tired he went lastly to the warm cubicles with their leather couches, fresh towels and thin undrawn curtains.  He lay listening to the feet that moved to and fro asking, taking, giving.  From his now half closed eyes he watched a lying couple copulate belly to belly, face to pressing face, and he heard their soft part stifled cries.      In time he heard feet come to him and a hand touched his shoulder.  He lay still as it traced down along his chest and stomach to the tangled hairs and touched the dead flesh that lay between his legs.  He made no sound as he felt the warm lips close over it and the gentle fingers caress his tightening sack.  For a long time the mouth pressed its charge forcing some response, then more and more until he burst out in a hot and silent pulsing.  The mouth took it all, touched his forehead lightly and left him to his sleep.     Maurice awoke himself.  Dressed and warm, he left ignoring the cold which now had no dominion over him. He went living through the light-night silvered streets where the frost reforged the rutted snow and glazed the broken panes of puddles.             The bad weather crippled travel, thinned the post and kept all but the most hardy bibliophile at home.  Business was slow everywhere.  Maurice had 'spring' cleaned the flat twice, rearranged many of the books,  and wrote out a simple catalogue.  Closing early most days he had taken to walking the mile and a half to the gymnasium.  There he punished himself for abusing and ignoring his body because he wasn't, inside his head, the man he  would like to be.      Now he would be the man he was and look after the body that housed that petulant mind.  It took a full week of busy workouts before he could forget that nearly every minute he wanted a drink.  Then it became easier and easier until he forgot what it was he was trying to forget.  He also found that the fitter he became the happier he became.     Late February came, never a joyful time being not spring nor real winter. This year there was still no sign, nor even hint of thaw, but it brought the first of three visitors who were to have lasting effects on Maurice's life.     Violet came first on a sleeting Thursday afternoon as he ushered the second and last customer of the day to the door of the shop.       The man had bought well from upstairs. He was pleased and profuse in his thanks promising wide recommendations among his friends.  Meanwhile, Maurice wondered where to put the large bundle of dollars until he could safely take it to the bank that held his foreign account.     "Well, I gotta go."  He held out his hand again and the sleet blew in through the door.     "Thank you.  Do come when you are next in Paris."     "You be sure to send those catalogues."     "Of course."  Maurice smiled and bent his head a little, more against the wet than in any deference.     "So long, hey, your cat looks like a drown rat."  The man laughed as a tiny cream and chocolate-pointed-snake on legs shot through the door and into the shop. Maurice looked round for the intruder as he slipped the top bolt.  Of the wet cat there was no sign but a damp trail lay across the parquet floor heading toward the stairs.  Maurice followed.  There by the stove, so close as to almost steam, sat the cat.  He approached carefully.  She turned her large blue eyes on him and he fell instantly in love.   He brought milk from the cupboard and she lapped it quickly.  He found a tin of salmon and opened it.  She ate daintily and licked her paws, then lay closer still to the heat, curled and drying in the soft light of the coals.  She was thin and collarless, though she was also a pedigree and must belong to someone.     For a long time Maurice just sat and looked at her until he knew who she was with her brown gloves and boots and her cream soft  skin.  He had seen her in a faded sepia photograph from the 1890's, She was, reincarnate, 'Violet', the actress who had eventually married the Comte d'Vose, after a very successful career as an 'understanding lady.'  As he thought the words he had chosen to euphemistically describe her earlier calling, he burst out into laughter at his own delicacy.     Violet opened one eye, regarded him with slight reproof then lept in one sure movement his lap, curled once, and was asleep again.  He sat for an hour stroking his beauty and staring into the hot coals. Both were warm, both dreamed, and both needed each other.     For the next week he advertised, asked questions and searched for her previous owners.   He feared finding them, but he had to try.  Violet just looked at him as if to say, 'I understand you need to do this, but I choose where  and with whom to live and I have chosen you.'       Each night she lay warm against him in the bed.  By day she sat on his desk, or prowled the books, or slept curled on the red tiles by the stove.  She would  patter downstairs if he was quiet too long, or she had not heard the door bell ring a customer.  She filled the shop and his life with her presence.      She gave love without demands.  She was there to greet him with raised tail and throaty purr on his return from the outside world, a world which appeared to hold no further interest for her.  She had come firmly into his life, both intended that she would stay there.  With a clear conscience he gave her the name he had chosen for her and a fresh fish - they were both graciously accepted.        The second visitor came disguised, as did the third.  They came announced by three notes thrust under the door from a D. Zollman.  Maurice had been at the gymnasium and Violet had watched from the top bookcase with blue suspicious eyes.      From the increasingly irate tone of the little misives it appeared that the writer took Maurice's absences as a personal affront directed at him.  He had left no address or telephone number, but stated he would call again.  The latter part of the message was underlined.       Maurice had already taken a dislike to the man, assuming it was a man as  few women came to the shop, before he was to make any personal aquaintance.  When he did it only exacerbated the already strongly formed opinion.     David Zollman was not a large man in any physical sense, yet he crowded the shop with his presence.  Most noticeable was the shock of thick black hair and the anthracite eyes that saw everything and let nothing out.  His stance and his voice, both a mixture of arrogant pride with a  weedling semi-servile charm, were constantly and variously employed to achieve whatever end he particularly had in mind.  At this time in Maurice's shop they were after books, special books,  books that might have ended here after the terrible diaspora of the last few years which Zollman described to Maurice as if he and he alone knew its true scale and import.       As Zollman spoke Maurice watched the great raw hands with their hairy backs and lumpy knuckled fingers twist and pull at themselves like huge broken legged spiders thrashing to stand up.  The more he watched them the less he heard the story that wove itself about him seeking to enmesh and snare him into Zollman's power.     "How did you hear about my shop?"  Maurice asked in the middle of the endless story of suffering.     Zollman stopped suddenly aware of the other’s indifference.  He changed his tack to simple business.  "I met a Frenchman who told me he had seen a certain book that I wish to buy back."     "You could identify this book?"     "All my books, my father's books and even before him are marked with our sign."     "And what is this sign?"     "A snake curled about a diamond."     "I have no such books."     "If I could just look, on page 32."     "There are the books, look."  Maurice turned to go to the desk.       Zollman followed, Violet yowled her dislike of the man and fled up the stairs to sit and watch from the safety of the top step.     "No, I heard there were other books that you did not have in the open shop."     "I think you have made a mistake."  Maurice was angry with the man's persistence.     "You do not have the Chasseur D'Amour?"     "No."  Maurice did not move a muscle in his face as he saw Lapointe pushing the book across the table to him, the present he had given to Eric, now given to him.     "You have sold it?"     "No."     "But he said an Englishman who had been in Angoulime…"     "If you give me a list of the books you are looking for, I shall contact you if I come across any of them."  Maurice drew paper and pen towards him.  "Do you wish to write them down?"     Zollman drew a sheaf of papers from his inner pocket.  "I have a full list here, I will pay well, very well, even for information."       Maurice took the papers and put them on top of the desk.  "I will remember that.  I'm sorry I cannot be more helpful."  He stood up.     "I am also sorry."       They stood looking at each other, each aware of the other's antipathy, then Zollman turned and left the shop.  As the bell clanged his exit Violet came down the stairs and wound herself about Maurice's legs as if to undo any spell the visitor may have left behind.     Maurice looked down the titles, he recognised many.  Most he had already sold, some still rested on the upstairs shelves. He had seen the snake and diamond.       "So if a Dutch Jew knows, who else knows?"     Violet turned her head slightly.     "How safe is it?  What else did that little French bastard say to him about me?"     She came to him, sensing his concern.  She rubbed her face against his hands and wrists until he caressed her ears and neck.     "Well the list is safe.  Nothing can be proven about the books except they may have once been his, and there is no way from me to Ernst or the rest so to hell with him."     Approving totally of the sentiment, Violet put her paws to his shoulders and butted his chin.  However, Maurice knew this was not the last of David Zollman.     The third visitor did not appear until the daffodils of a late April spring yellowed the parks and gardens of the city.  This visitor also masqueraded as a customer, but it was not books that were wanted.     The bell clanged and Maurice looked up from the desk.  Violet was asleep on the corner of the blotting paper, but she, too, heard the bell.  A young slight thin-faced boy stood at the door, hesitating at the sound that marked his entry.  Maurice deliberately went back to his book and the boy began to walk along the shelves, but too fast to read or even note the titles and Maurice knew that he was being watched.     Maurice waited.  The boy was close now, his small beautiful hands pulled at a book, holding it as if unfamiliar with the weight and texture.  They were lovely hands and they reminded Maurice of other hands that had drawn long soul-searching sounds from metal, wood, and reed.     He knew this faun would run if startled. He stayed sitting and silently running his own hand over the soft sleek body of the half sleeping Violet.  The boy watched, the face drawn sad, wistful, lost within itself.  Not a city face, the skin too dark, the eyes pale, half green half hazel, the hair short and brown under the cap.       "Are you Maurice?"  The words no more than a whisper.     He looked up.  "I am Maurice."     "Claude was my brother."     The face before him and the memory face of the saxophonist swam together and agreed.     "Francoise?"     So  she was not a boy despite the hair, the boots and the heavy workman's cord trousers.  He watched the hands press themselves against each other seeking solace, or strength.  She, no longer he, wiped the palms against the rough material pushing it against her thighs which he imagined thin and pale.     "Claude said I should try to find you."     "He is..."  Maurice did not want to say dead.     She nodded, also not wanting to say the word.     "Tell me."  said Maurice, "I will close for lunch."     She watched him move to the door to slide the bolt, and turn the sign over. She pressed herself against the desk as he came back.  Violet rose, turned and stretched out reaching for Francoise, her claws hooking to the coarse hair of the jacket and pulling herself into the surprised arms of the unexpected lunch guest.     Maurice climbed the stairs, "Come on, both of you," he called over his shoulder making it easier for everyone.     Francoise ate hungrily and silently.  Now Maurice watched her every move, her hands, the tiny wrists, the small body curved over the plate. The soft brown hurt eyes and the lips stained with the dark sauvignon sipped from the rough glass.     He did not drink, ate little, held Violet on his lap and his curiosity in check.  She would talk soon when she had eaten.  He had all the time they needed.     "They killed Claude."  She had not looked up.       "Who?"     "Collaborators."     "Why?"     "He was Maquis, he knew who they were, he told..."  She bent further.  "It's never over is it?"     "No."  said Maurice.  "It's never over.  Tell me."     She shook her head.  "There's nothing to tell.  He had come home, he had been warned, it was dangerous what he was doing."     Every word had to be drawn like healthy teeth.     "He and others court-martialled collaborators.  Some...men followed him and garrotted him and threw him in a ravine."  She looked up at him, vulnerable, not really understanding.       Lost and in his shop, his shop, the man who knew about collaborators and who had  loved her brother.  That was what he was now telling himself.     "He told you about me?"     "In a letter, that you came to hear him play, sold books and lived here and..."     "And?"     "That he liked you."     "Ah."     "Why did you come?"     She shrugged.  "I don't know. To see. To be where he was."     "Revenge, perhaps?"     "No."     An intuition flashed across his consciousness.  "Your brother killed first because of you."     The wide eyes and the hand confessed the truth of his words. Later, when the crying stopped and all was spilled out in front of him like grains from a rotten sack he learnt of her rape.  And of the exsanguinating soldier chocked to death with his own cock. And of Claude fleeing from the farm to fight for France.  He learnt of the Maquis in her area, he learnt of who, and when.      Then Claude made his way to Paris.  She remembered names, those who had collaborated with the Nazis. Name after name he had written to her and she had remembered.  He paid them to her like a wirgeld hoping to heal the wound torn open by lust, drink, conquest and a country boy only four years older than herself.        "I'm sorry."  She was touching his arm.  "I have worried you."     Fear and and memory twisted inside him, the familiar walked again.     "No, no problem at all."  He looked at her.  "Just thoughts and memories.  I must reopen."      He retreated and let a wall arise, but did not know if it was to keep her out or him in.     "And I must go."  She was stronger now.  She had unburdened, confessed.     "Where?"  He was surprised, he had not thought of her as going, nor staying.     She hesitated.     "I have some things at the station."     "You are going back home to the farm?"     She shook her head.  "No, I .... will get work here and a room."     "Yes."  There was more he wanted to say.  "Until you are settled, if you wish, there is room here."  He stood up and Violet protested at being moved. Francoise put out her hand and touched the cats ears, Violet rubbed herself against the proffered hand.  She was doing her best to help them communicate again.  The girl's hand was shaking.     "Thank you."     They went downstairs and Violet settled on the desk to watch the afternoon.  Maurice closed the door behind Francoise.  He did not really expect to see her again; it might  be better for both of them if he didn't.      April 1947 to May 1948.                            He was shut.  He had been shut for over an hour and he was going to stay shut.  He would ignore the knocking.  If Zollman wanted something he could leave another of his damned notes under the door.       Maurice continued preparing his meal and the knocking stopped as he knew it eventually would.  He smiled at the thought of the frustration that his refusal to accede to the imperious demands of Meinher Zollman must have caused.  Petty enough for certain, but curiously satisfying.   Maurice knew that it was obvious he was in, as anyone looking from across the street could see his shadow move over the opaque eye of the blind-drawn window.     Violet wound round his feet as he finely chopped the onion.  For her, onion meant meat and she ignored his protestations of meatlessness as he had ignored the door.        "I'm making an omelette, a Spanish omelette and you've already been fed."     It made no difference.  He bent to stroke her silken coat, she raised her head to him.  He would please her, there was a little ham in the cupboard.     As he turned the pan, drawing it from the heat to turn the contents onto the waiting plate, she sat chewing daintily on the thin strips of ham he had cut for her.  She was satisfied and confirmed in her rightness, - onion meant meat.     Maurice ate slowly, thinking about Zollman.  Did he dislike him for any particular reason, a reason that if it were removed would make liking possible?  He did not think so.  He just did not like Zollman and he had little sympathy for his suffering.  What disturbed Maurice as he ate was the belief that he should, if not like or even tolerate Zollman, at least have sympathy for his losses,  losses that he somehow made more obviously deliberate than the losses of others.       The loss of his own grandparents was not a personally motivated act against them, although the act of rocketing London had been.  But in Zollman's case the losses he suffered were because he was Zollman and a Jew.        Maurice made coffee.  Well, if Ernst was right, then the Jews would soon have their own country and that should solve a lot of problems.  It would probably create a few, too. They could live there if they didn't like it anywhere else, or they could just accept what came their way as they had had to for the last couple of thousand years.       "There's got to be a good reason why someone has that long a history of persecution."      Violet growled her agreement as she worried the last strip of meat.     "Bit rough on the people already living there, though, if they don't like the Jews either."     Maurice was not too sure of the exact situation in Palestine, quite how much was desert, or who actually did live there.  It was a gap in his knowledge that he intended to repair, for all he could currently recall was that Allenby and Lawrence had fought the Turks somewhere in that region in the first war.     There was a knock again on the door, this time more subdued, but clear.  Violet looked up her head half-turned as if she knew who it was.  The knock rapped again up the wooden stairs.  Maurice drained his cup.  Again it called.  Then the  silence lengthened as whoever it had been gave up.      He pushed the coffee pot onto the low gas.  He would check downstairs, just in case.  He paused at the foot of the stairs, Violet at his feet.   The shop shelved darkly before him to the street door that framed a sky lit figure whose head rested against the glass.       "Who the hell..."  Maurice whispered to himself to dispell the sudden light and unexplained surge of fear that ran through him.     He walked slowly toward the door.  As he approached the figure-part turned, the pale face caught the moonlight and reflected Claude's deathmask into the shop.  Even as he knew it was Francoise returned, he felt a hand close about his heart and for a short moment shut off the pump of blood.  Shaken, he drew a breath and the bolt.  She came in with her thin cardboard case and a small bag to stand waiting as he closed the door and gestured her  to follow Violet up the stairs.     Neither the explanation, nor the unpacking of the case and bag took much time.  She had taken some part time work in a bar nearby, she could find nothing else, there was not enough money for a room, yet.  But as soon as there was...she went on with the words while Maurice finished putting a couch bed together for her on the far side of the big room.  He would suspend a blanket from some hooks in the beam above to give her some privacy.       Her return and her total vulnerability excited him.  Was she always cold and hungry he wondered?  He half-looked over at her where she sat cradling Violet in her thin arms, her body, even at rest it looked as if it were retreating from an expected, but not altogether unwelcomed blow.       Intuitively he knew that her body housed the soul of a victim.  If only that body had been male. She looked at him and smiled as he stood up from the completed task.  Yes, she was a victim, but in what role was he to be cast?          And what role would she accept?  He had accepted the role of loyal servant offered him by Ernst, a role that began as offered friendship, his to have and hold, had he been equal to it.  Not that Ernst had ever put it that way, nor ever would. But Maurice knew, more clearly now than ever before, that only equals could be true friends.  All that the others could be were masters or servants.  But, as his grandfather might have said, none the less for that.     He went across to her and stood close, invading her space, but she did not move.  He put his hand on her shoulder, the fingers resting on the thin blouse, his thumb pushing into the hollow at the base of her neck.     "Are you sure about this?"  he asked ambiguously.     "Yes."  her voice soft.  "It’s a nice room."     He tightened his grip watching the pain play over her face and brighten the pale green eyes as the thumb bruised the flesh, then he drew her head roughly against his shirt.  He held her there for awhile feeling her breath.  Despite her femininity he felt himself desiring her.  A memory returned of a young sailor in a station toilet; taken, because he could be taken.    Did possession and power excite beyond gender?  Letting go, he stood back.     "You look as if you could do with a coffee."     Surprise?  Disappointment?  Perhaps even excitement.  He was not certain what that particular expression meant.  But the game and the contract offered were still open and he would keep it that way for awhile.  Perhaps, dressed as she had been that first day; frightened and submissive…he let the thought linger and then filed it for the future and opportunity.     It was later, while Francoise washed the few dishes from her meal and his coffee, that he remembered the first loud knocking earlier in the evening.     "There was no one, I'm certain."     "No note or anything at all?"  Maurice was puzzled.     "Nothing."  Francoise was certain of that.     Well, it was possible that Zollman had not bothered to leave a message, unless of course it had not been Zollman.  It was possible that it could have been anyone.  Yet that thought made him feel nervous.  Who would call at a time he was obviously shut, and who would knock like the police?  Unless it was the police.  But why should they call when they could come in anytime he was open and be welcomed?  It was now an unwelcome mystery that would keep him awake for some time while Violet paced between his bed and that of their new house guest who slept well blanketed on the couch below.     It was some weeks later when the letter from Ernst arrived and by then the unexplained knocking on the night Francoise had arrived was long forgotten.  She was still working most afternoons and early evenings in the bar of the Cafe Colomb.  For the rest of the time she tidied the shop and kept 'house' for Maurice.  Now he only cooked and shopped when he wished, leaving the rest to her.  Apart from the hanging blanket, there was no visible indication that she was actually there in the building.  She had no possessions on display, left no presence, pots, clothes or even a toothbrush in the bathroom.  All that she needed went in and out of the suitcase which she stored under the couch that was returned to its sitting function by day.       No visitor - and there had been quite a few of them - to the upstairs stock would have known that someone was sleeping in the same room as the books they had come to see.   There had been no sign, nor note from Zollman.  Neither had there had been any further game, nor  hint of physicality or even the expectation of it between Maurice and Francoise.  There was, however, a growing bond that neither could define that drew them into a conspiracy of knowing.     The letter was not long; it was friendly and it was cryptic.  Ernst was in Palestine, he had new friends there. Some old friends would be travelling out to join him and they would stop by to see Maurice.  Ernst hoped they would not be an inconvenience if they stayed for a day or so until their courier arrived to help them on their way.  If they happened to leave anything he was sure that Maurice could 'take care' of it as he had done with the 'other' books.  It ended with the hope they would see each other again soon.  At the bottom, below the gothic 'E' by which Ernst signed his name, was a short PS:  'I think the 'Red Dawn' is about to do us a favour!'     That made no sense at all to Maurice.  However, visitors could present a problem.  There was room for them, but where would Francoise go?       "I could get a room now."  She had saved all her money as Maurice refused to let her pay for anything.     He shook his head.  He did not want her to leave, her presence reminded him of Claude.  She was also a human presence.  A presence that made it harder for the loneliness and self-abnegation that silently  dogged Maurice to take more permanent root.    "You could have my room," he said.     "No."  She was adamant until he forced her to choose between that or her first suggestion which she really wanted no more than he did.  So it was settled, he would sleep in the same room as his guest or guests and Francoise would have his bed.     As if the one event had precipitated the other, Zollman called in the shop the afternoon of the morning that had brought Ernst's letter.  Whilst Maurice had been happy to receive the letter, he was certainly not happy to see Zollman again.     Zollman stood before the desk, his twisting and pulling as before, yet his whole manner was more placable than it had previously been.      "I called to see if you had come across any of the books on the list I left with you?"  His voice was less strident, too.     Maurice was about to dismiss him with apologies and firmness, saying how difficult it was these days to find exact titles etc., when the door bell announced another buyer.  The man came to the desk.  His 'bonjour' reeked American and cigar as he handed Maurice a letter of introduction.     Maurice took the man to a shelf of books.      “If you would wait just a moment,” he spoke softly.       The man understood and took a volume from the shelf.        Maurice returned to Zollman.        “I believe, “ he said, “that I may have found something of interest to you.”         He watched certainty and satisfaction play across the face.  “Now if you could just wait a moment I must remember where I put it.”  Maurice began up the stairs.  He went immediately to a far pile of books and drew one out.  Every creak made him think Zollman was behind him.  The snake and diamond was on page thirty-two.  He hurried back down the stairs.         “Here,” he passed him the book. “ I'm sorry to have taken so long.”      Zollman took the book, he looked at the page, held it close to him muttering in Hebrew, some sort of prayer or welcome home Maurice thought to himself.     "Is this the only one?"     "Unfortunately it is."  Maurice knew he was sounding like a shoe salesman who took pleasure in only having the wrong size in the right style.            "And your price?"     Maurice held out his hand for the book.  "I must look at my note on the leaf."       Zollman opened the book, showing the page to Maurice, but not letting go as if he feared it may vanish or be taken back.  Maurice knew he could ask any price and get it.  He saw his code figure, doubled it and then changed his mind.  He halved the true amount and asked that.     Zollman sighed.  He took out his wallet and paid in new notes.  "I hope you will find more of them.  Perhaps even the Chasseur?"     "I think that very unlikely indeed."  he spoke firmly.     "One never knows."  Zollman looked at him with a sad face.  "You were kind enough to find this one for me.  Could you tell me where you obtained it?"     "It was among some random purchases.  Sheer luck.  I can tell you no more than that."     "Thank you.  Thank you again.  You still have the others?"     Maurice smiled at him.  "Your list, of course."     "Ah, good."  Zollman turned and left the shop without looking back.      It was only as Maurice was wrapping the parcel of books the American had chosen and paid for in dollars that Maurice happened to look out of the window and see that Zollman was standing in the doorway of the empty house opposite.  He  must have seen the American come upstairs and now he would see him leave.  There was no back way out.     "I'll call a taxi for you."     "I can walk. They ain't heavy."     "I think considering how much you have paid, it would be safer to go by taxi."     He looked at Maurice for a moment.  "Hmm, perhaps you are right."Zollman looked up to the window as the taxi left the front of the shop Maurice knew that he knew he alone was being denied access to 'his' books and that he would be back.  But there was little Maurice could do immediately. It was nearly four and there was usually a crowd who came in then, it being a Wednesday.  They came for coffee and for a browse among that week's reduced general and university texts.  He would have to wait until the evening to make a final cull of the special stock.      He would withdraw all the serpent and diamond marked books. They could be sent to Angoulime and sold off at random there.  If he fixed their price, then his ‘manager’ need know no more about them than that.      With Francoise's unquestioning help, he had withdrawn twenty-four books and packaged them for Angoulime before retiring to bed.  He could not sleep.   A sixth sense of unease suggested that the quicker the books were off the premisies the better.  A phone call brought a car and driver over from a customer who was also on the Phoenix list.  He was happy to hold the crate until the morning when Maurice could leave Francoise in the shop, collect the crate and post it to Angoulime himself.  It was not that he did not trust; just that as Ernst often said, the less someone knows the less they can let slip.     The hammering at 3 am was not unexpected, yet it hurled Maurice from his fitfull sleep leaving him cold and shaky.  He slipped on his dressing gown and met Francoise at the door to the books room.  She had her outdoor coat wrapped around her, her pale face and wide eyes spoke of her fear.     "The Boche?"  she whispered, "They come at night.  The Boche."     "It’s nothing, be quiet, please."     "Boche, Boche."  Her voice was rising and she began to shake.       Maurice grabbed her as the hammering intensified.  "Find Violet, she will be afraid.  Find her."  He shook her sharply until her eyes focused on him.  "Violet."  He said again as she broke away from him.     There was an unmarked van outside the shop.  Two men in heavy overcoats were at the door and Maurice suspected more were not far away.     "Mr. Vigor, Internal Security."  He thrust a paper at Maurice.  "Search warrant."       Maurice stood aside.  "At three in the morning?"  Was all he said.  I have under estimated Zollman and his contacts, was what he was thinking.     The two men went straight up the stairs while three others came in from the van.  Maurice went to go after them.     "Just wait here."  He felt his arm gripped.     "I have..."  As he spoke he saw Francoise brought down the stairs by one of the first men in.  She was holding Violet in her arms and whispering softly to her.  Maurice pulled his arm free and stood beside her at his desk.       A small man in a dark suit, hatted and bespectacled, his hands in his jacket pocket, walked over to them.     "What are you looking for?  If I know I may be able to help you."  Maurice asked quietly keeping his voice low and steady.     "Stolen books, prohibited books."  The man lent close to Maurice.  "Nazi papers, perhaps, Mr. Vigor."     Francoise pushed herself close to him, Violet was quieter now.  Maurice shrugged, but said nothing as he put his arm round the still trembling woman.  Upstairs he could hear the men moving about as they pulled books from the shelves and searched in cupboards.     "I keep the more expensive books up there," he said. "I do hope your men will be careful."     Hat and glasses said nothing.     "I suppose someone with a grudge has made accusations because I am a foreigner doing well."     His comment was ignored.     "I've found this."  Overcoat 'one' was holding a wad of dollars in his hand as he came down the stairs.     "Give him a recieipt.  Holding foreign currency is an offence, Mr. Vigor."     Maurice said nothing.     Overcoat 'two' and a third man now came down.  They gestured with empty hands to 'hat and spectacles' and then waited.     "Nothing?"  He appeared puzzled.     "Nothing, chief."     "Right, take it apart down here, too."          It was dawn before they left, empty-handed except for the dollars. The shop was a mess, nothing that could not be tidied, but it would take most of the day and they were now both tired.  Upstairs was worse.  All the books were off the shelves and in Maurice's bedroom everything had been scattered as the men had desperately searched for what they really believed to be there.  Francoise said nothing and asked nothing.  She made coffee, fed Violet and then began with the downstairs.      Maurice ran his finger down the subscriptions list, looking for a name, a name that had been pointed out by Ernst for use in just such an emergency.  He picked up the phone and dialed.        Later while Francoise had the shop tidy enough to open, he took a long and tortuous route to collect the crate and then post it away to the safety of Angoulime.  As he tore up the postage receipt, he reflected on his wisdom in keeping neither record nor note of the Angoulime shop in Paris.    He also was grateful that none of Ernst's friends had been in the building either.  Perhaps he would have to make other arrangements for them now.  What, he wondered as he turned into the road, had Zollman really alleged and how much further might it be taken?  Certainly, whatever it was Zollman had said was obviously considered serious enough to warrant a night raid?     He found the shop busy; word of the raid had got round.  The whisper  was that 'erotic' books had been seized, but perhaps some had been missed, or some could still be ordered.      The day ended with an unusual profit from the downstairs sales as even the least likely candidates as erotic books had been bought on the off-chance.  The art and Greek shelves, the ethnography and 'social' studies sections and foreign novels all looked like fields after locusts.  He would have a lot of restocking to do.  Perhaps some of the new stock should aim to satisfy the obvious demand for the risky and more adventurous tastes of the locale.  It was worth thinking about at least.       He was also still thinking about Ernst's suggestion, and Ernst had made it clear it was no more than a suggestion, that he should have a section on racial and related issues.       For the next couple of days Francoise remained nervous, which was something Maurice quite understood.  However she refused to talk to him about her previous experiences that had exacerbated her natural timidity and this annoyed him. Had she not told him of the rape?  Why then would she not talk of the events afterwards?  She had been questioned by the Gestapo about the death of the soldier, and about her brother's disappearance -  that much he knew, but she would say no more. Her silence on this matter was not a good omen yet neither took heed of it, they just let it rest for the moment unresolved.  Both knew it would emerge again, perhaps even stronger, then it would become a test of intent.  Later Maurice was to believe that it had on Francoise's part been an intentional means to make him enter fully into her world of games and roles.      On the Friday of the week of the raid the shop was visited again by the representative of the state.  This time it was very different.  A discrete car stopped outside.  A tall grey-haired man entered and introduced himself, and was full of apologies.  There had been a regretable mistake.  It was unpardonable that a respectable and most welcome business man had been subjected to such an indignity on the unsupported word of, he almost said Jew, a madman.  It was the war; things were difficult; accusations and counter accusations flew about like autumn leaves.  Maurice said he understood.  The officer should not have taken it upon himself to act as he did.  Maurice was to rest assure that the man had been disciplined.  Would he accept apologies and the assurance that nothing like this would happen again?  Maurice said he would.  The man passed him an envelope.  The dollars were returned, however it would be better if as far as that was concerned, he declared any foreign currency as exchange controls were a very different and very serious matter.  Maurice understood that as well.  A telephone number was left in case he was further disturbed by such 'stupidity'.  His hand was shaken and the man departed.     So it appeared that he too now had contacts that were even more powerful than those of Zollman.  Obviously a power game was being enacted somewhere on the Olympian heights of government and he was considered to be important enough to be a protected part of its foundations.  Once again he could only surmise what role his absent friend actually played in this network of mutual support.  But support or not, invisibility and silence were still the keys to their survival.  Ernst had made that abundantly clear often enough.     To his surprise, his report of this visit did not make Francoise any less nervous. If anything she seemed even more upset.  Regardless of his growing impatience with her, he let the matter rest, preferring to press the question of her refusal to eat substantially despite her obvious hunger.       "Why do you only ever pick at food? Violet eats more than you."  He kept his voice as neutral as he could.     She shook her head, tears in her eyes and would not or could not answer him.       He began to force her to eat.  He threatened and cajoled, if she would not eat with him she could leave.  Her tears did not weaken his resolve. It was for her own good and that fact gave him the strength to persist.  He would watch while she forced the food into her mouth and swallowed it.  He would keep her at the table until he left to work in the shop or to go over the books in the evenings.  Often he heard her crying in the toilet after these sessions, but even that did not stop him.  She would emerge red-eyed and pale faced and he would hold her for a moment rewarding her with soft words and praise.       The first week in May saw the arrival of two of the 'guests' the letter had warned him to expect.  Both were men in their early thirties with hard blue eyes and thin angular faces whose physical stiffness was matched by their clipped and unilluminating speech.  Despite his earlier plans Maurice did not sleep in the big room, but on the floor of his own room while Francoise had the bed.  She was in terror of the men and avoided them as much as was possible.  She gave no reasons for her feelings and on this matter Maurice did not press her.     The men spent the morning in the room looking at the books, smoking innumerable cigarettes, to Maurice's annoyance, and talking between themselves in a quiet monotone.  At noon they went out and did not return until dark.  They had eaten and asked nothing more than a glass of water each as they retired into the room.  By observation Maurice was convinced that they, too, were headed to the near East, probably to join Ernst, but he was afforded no opportunity to confirm that by talking to either man.  On the third day their courier arrived and the men departed as quietly and anonymously as they had arrived.     A week later, on the 15th, Maurice read that the day before at four in the afternoon, David Ben-Gurion had announced the the beginning of the State of Israel and that the 'united' Arab war against the Jews had intensified.  The destination of his late 'guests' made sense.     When on the 22nd of June the crisis in Berlin saw the virtual isolation of the city with the closure of the final rail link by the Russians who totally objected to the proposed unified currency, Maurice at last understood the cryptic PS in Ernst's last letter.  Within a few days the former allies were now the enemy and the former enemy were being praised as brave defenders of their liberty supported by the West.  How could Ernst have known?  Unless he had been party to the proposals which it was known the Russians could not accept.  Despite defeat, were there men who were still shaping the course of the future?  Men who had supporters in the West?  It was not a subject Maurice wished to pursue, he had enough problems with Francoise.     Over the next fortnight he played host to ten silent men who came to the shop by day and night.  They  stayed and left without words except those necessary for the most basic needs.  Each time the courier was a different person and apart from a simple identification, they, too, said nothing.  Maurice took the papers and the  photographs of book plates that were given to him and sent them to Angoulime to be stored, sealed against opening, for later retreival.  Then, without notice, the flow of travelling comrades dried up.  Days became weeks and weeks months without guests.  This exodus was over.  He was again only a bookseller.       It was with the cessation of the 'guests' that a not unforeseeable confrontation between Maurice and Francoise occurred.  He had not pressed her about avoiding the men who came and went as they had sought as little contact as she did.  She had asked no questions although he knew she suspected something.  What brought the hidden stresses to the forfront was the issue of food.      It had been a hot sticky day in early August and it was now early evening.  Maurice was irritable and tired and glad to close the door on the last of the browsers and book movers who seemed incapable of replacing a volume in the same place they had taken it from.      He went upstairs. Violet was sunning herself on the window ledge.  He stopped to caress her and was rewarded with a soft throaty purr.  In the kitchen, the thin summer dress hanging from her shoulders,  Francoise stood listlessly at the sink staring out of the window to the wall of the building opposite.  On the table was a salad and a place setting for one.     "I've eaten."  She replied quietly to his question.  Both knew it was a lie.     He sat down at the table his back to her, before she would say she'd eaten at the cafe, now, as it was closed for two weeks, she would have to pretend to have eaten when he was working.       "I want you to eat when I eat."  He made the words come out hard and clear.     She came and sat opposite him.     "Get a plate."     She didn't move.     "Get a plate."     "I'll just sit, I'm not hungry."  She was trying to appease him now.     "If you don't eat you will get sick and die.  Is that what you want?"     She bowed her head.     "Is it!?"  He suddenly screamed at her.     Francoise twisted back and away from him as if he had struck her, he reached across the table and caught her left arm.     "Is it?  Is it?  Is it?"       He repeated the words as he pulled her towards him her body folding at the hips as her stomach, breasts, and face were pressed to the wooden surface by the pressure he was putting on her elbow.  He took her head with his free hand and forced her face into the salad bowl.        "Eat it."       He hissed the words at her bending down toward her ear.  She didn't struggle, but he felt her head shake refusal.  He drove her face into the bowl then let go and stood up.  She stayed where he had abandoned her, her face pushed into the  oiled leaves, her body bent over the table.     "This is what you want, isn't it, to be abused, to be punished."  He was not asking a question.  He was stating a fact.       Her head moved slowly in assent.     "Sit up."     She slipped back into the chair, her face shone with the oil and a thin line of red appeared over her cheek from the slight cut the edge of the bowl had made above her right eye.       "Please."  Her words no more than a half whisper.  "I'm sorry."     "For what?"  Her weakness corrupted his voice to a sneer.     "Bertold, Claude."  Her  eyes spilled a little wetness  to mix with the oil and blood.     "What about Claude?  Was Bertold the soldier?”     "I killed them."     "That's stupid."       "I killed them," she repeated.     "Bertold raped you?"      Maurice had been right, Bertold had been the soldier.     "And you believe that was your fault?"  His voice softer, his sudden anger and frustration gone.     "Yes."     He passed her a towel.     "Wipe your face."     She did as he bid.     "Why do you believe that?"     "Father Pierre said I led him on."     "Did you?"     "I liked him, he was kind to me, he brought me things.  Then," her voice broke for a moment,  "one night, he had been drinking, he wanted to, he wanted..."     "And you didn't?"     She shook her head, "If I did people would know, I would be a collaborator.  You know what happens to such girls."     It was a statement and Maurice nodded, he knew.     "So he raped you and Claude killed him for that."     She was crying so softly there was no sound, just tears.     "And now you are starving yourself to death with guilt and self pity."       Maurice came and stood behind her his hands on her shoulders.  Her tears continued.  Oh how he understood.  More than she would ever know he understood.  Yet her pain, her weakness also excited him.  Not sexually, yet not without a sensual component.  He wanted to dominate her, to take charge, to make her well and to make her will his.     "Claude killed Bertold because he wanted to, because he saw it as his duty."  Maurice was not sure of his words, but he pressed on.  "He wanted to fight, for France, for his honour, for himself.  You gave him the excuse to do what he really wanted to do."     "Now he is dead," sobs cut the words into pieces.     Maurice wondered if this was the first time she had grieved for her brother.     "I loved Claude, too."  He spoke quietly and knew now that he would do with her what he had not been able to do with Claude.  " I was responsible for the death of another man in the war," he added as if to obscure and mitigate the truth he had not meant to speak, even to himself.      They stayed a tableau, seated and standing, locked in their own selves.  The final crossing would be, could be made.  Not now, but one day.     The room grew dark.     "Are you a Nazi?"  Her voice was without expression.     "No,"  he did not have the courage even to admit in private, he thought.     "Anti?" He said to make it easier.     She nodded her head.     "No, I am not anti."  He may as well say it.     "You do not like women."     It was not a question.     "No."  What now was there to lose.  She must know he could never love her, whatever she would suffer at his will, whatever his dreams, his fantasies enacted.  With her he would need no gun, nor money to buy the servitude.       "Are you going to leave?"  He had to ask that.     "If you wish."  Her voice was stronger.  "Do you?"     "No."     "Then I will stay."     "And eat?"     Her head hardly moved, but it was a yes.  Obedience demanded and accepted.      By mid-winter it was clear from the papers that the Jews in Israel were winning the war; the Arab states could not agree. They fought each other as much as their old enemy and so factioned were defeated.  Ernst returned.  He looked older and more tired than before, but the spirit was as bright as ever.  He sat at the kitchen table, a glass of schnapps swirling in his hand.  He smiled at Francoise who trembled when he looked at her.     "It will soon be finished in Berlin."     Maurice was slow to catch the jump in the conversation.     "The blockade.  It is hurting the Soviet more than the West, you see.  Our first victory there will be bloodless."     "Do you really think so?  Yesterday I overheard someone suggesting that it could come to war."     "Never, not with the bomb only in the West."  Ernst lent forward,  "I happen to know..."  he stopped.  "Well, it doesn't matter about that.  But you can count on no war, that much I will tell you."  He reflected for a moment in silence, then he spoke so softly Maurice barely heard the words.  "Which is more than you can do with the Arabs."  He put down the glass from which he had hardly drunk.  "Now then, to work."       Maurice looked at him expectantly.     "Long term plans my old friend, very long term plans and they will continue from here with your agreement."     Ernst had heard all about the 'raid' on the shop and about Zollman, but he was, as he put it, 'certain' that there would be no further problems on either count.  For a moment, the news of the warehouse fire disturbed him, but finally he just shrugged and made no comment. Then he looked up at Francoise who froze instantly in his steel smile.     "We need some things from the market."  Maurice sprung the jaws of the trap for her, she took the basket and fled from the room.     "She looks as if she is eating more."     "A little. I insist and she obeys."     "Good. Now have you thought about the race and education section I suggested?"     Maurice nodded.     "And?"     "I have a few books, mainly academic."     "Then keep it that way.  Go for the learned output, go for names, plus myth, legend and history.  I will have some very carefully written pamphlets sent for you to mix in with these.  I also suggest that we stock, I apologise, you stock, certain Marxist-Leninist texts as a balance.  Again I will have suggestions sent that we would like put over to the readers.”  He picked up the glass and swirled the spirit watching it cling to the side and then run back into the bowl.       "The Soviets have learnt nothing from their own history.  They will try to hold to too much too hard and they will fail.  Don't look so surprised.  I give them fifty years, no more, and when they go down they will take the whole idea with them.  We on the other hand have learnt, and we have friends in many places, many high places.  They are not the problem.   It is, once again, the fickle masses that need convincing.  We must sanitize our mistakes, which will not be easy."       Ernst fell into a silent reverie while Maurice waited.     "Will the group want to meet here again?"  he eventually asked.     "Now and then.  But it would be better if you could specialise in providing books, encouraging others to do the same.  Lutz will be printing and needs outlets.  Force has been tried; now we will try the waiting game like Fabian.  There is a lot that can be learnt from the Roman Empire."          Much to Francoise's terror Ernst stayed with them for three more days.  She spent as much time as she could in the shop while the two men went into details concerning books, catalogues and the possibilities of other outlets for the material Ernst had in mind.  Maurice found her even more quiet than previously, although she joined them for meals and ate what was put before her.          "When is he coming back?"  she asked as Ernst left them early on the Monday morning despite the heavy flurries of snow that threatened another very cold winter.     "It will be a while."  was all Maurice said, still thinking of all that had been planned.  The Angoulime shop would remain in the background as a safe store for the more sensitive material.  He would set up another shop in Paris and make plans for some more in the South.      He knew that others were at work in the USA, Canada and South Africa which was to be Ernst's base for the next few years.  He was to  manage the new branch of the Essen firm, Vogel Gmb, that was being set up out there.       Francoise made no response to his reply, but her lighter step and small smile made her relief obvious, to Maurice's irritation although he did not show it.     Within the next two years he had set up a shop in the Les Halles district that was doing very well with a combination of 'racy' books and 'self education' pamphlets that were coming from the Lutz press and their new Dutch partners.  The shop in Nice specialised in tourist material and well illustrated historical texts.  It also had a thriving mail order section of military collectibilia.      By now the original upstairs books had all gone, but he had decided to leave the Angoulime books where they were.  He could find enough firsts on the open market to keep him going as an antiquarian.  Now most profit came from the books Ernst had arranged downstairs.  Not that money was a problem, he had funds enough to send pamphlets to any enquirer and to keep the new 'education' texts at a more than attractive price.  In the world of books, and as Ernst's and the group's outlet, he was doing very well.       The same could not be said of his relationship with Francoise.       Not that they fought; he wished they would - at least it would be something.  She went out less and less.  She showed little interest in anything except the occassional trial of the now and again unearthed "War Criminals" that splashed across the papers.  Fortunately, that was becoming less frequent as the problems of the Cold War took up more and more print space.       That grief and guilt still haunted her, Maurice was certain.  What to do about it was not.  She would not travel with him to Nice or Angoulime, but was always waiting when he returned to the shop.  He offered to help her visit her home, to give her money to stay there should she wish it.  She did not.     "There is nothing there.  I have no father and mother now, no family.  I have nothing at all."  She would say no more, nor listen to anything else Maurice had to say on the subject.     So they lived above the shop.  Many took them for man and wife and addressed her as Madame Vigor.  She made no correction or objection.     If Maurice went out, or came in late, she asked no questions.  She never mentioned the August confessions.  And so their life went on.                           June 1951 to June 1952.     There was something about King George the VI that reminded him ofHorace.  He looked again at the photograph.  Both he and Queen Elizabeth had aged.  So had we all.  1938, yes, '38, that was the last time he had seen pictures of them both.  He and Ernst had had a long weekend in Paris.  The memories flooded back of Union Jacks and Royal Photographs in the shops, and of the cafe on the same street he now lived.  Different patron, same cafe.     "Maurice."  Francoise called from upstairs shattering the images.     "Yes?"      "Coffee?"     "Please."      "I'll bring it down."       Her English is definitely improving, he thought.  Still an accent, but better than it had been. Why was it the French had so much trouble with the accent?  Particularly with the haitche.  Unlike the Germans, but then they were Ayrian, Anglo-Saxon.  Same stock, similar linguistic root.      He kept staring at the photograph.     Got it.  The nose.  Horace and the King had the same nose.  They also had that drawn look of the habitual heavy smoker.     Francoise placed the cup on the desk.  He didn't look up.     She put her hand on his shoulder, lightly, briefly.     "I'm sorry, I was just being…"  she stumbled with the word and then continued in French, "...silly. I know he is your friend, your good friend.  This is your house, of course, he must come here."     Maurice looked up at her.     "I know you are frightened of him, but there is no reason to be.  He would be your friend, too."    She shook her head.  "I cannot help it.  Violet does not like him either."    Maurice smiled, typical.  When either of them argued, which now was not often, an appeal to Violet would be made to arbitrate any disagreements.  If it were too hot, too cold, too quiet, too much noise, whatever, then what Violet wanted or felt would be the decider.       "It's alright," he said and saw her relax with his words.  "But a letter does not always mean he is coming, he didn't say he would.  Here, take the paper and read all about the Festival of Britain."  He handed her the week old copy of the Daily Telegraph and picked up his cup.     She took the paper and went back upstairs.     No, he thought, a letter didn't always mean Ernst would arrive, but a letter had often proceeded his visits in the past.  It was a pity Francoise didn't care for Ernst.  But in truth, Maurice was more upset that Violet had such an antipathy to his friend.  Whenever Ernst was in the room she would hide as far out of sight as she could, refusing to even come out for tidbits of ham or salmon.  At least Francoise did not go that far.     Once again Ernst had been right, the Labour Government had not lasted.  Last year's victory, albeit with a much reduced majority, had now given way to defeat.       'The British press will destroy them and their dream of socialism.'  So Ernst had written in a letter last year.  'The British want to forget the war and with it rationing, greyness and tight belts.'  Cripps and his austerity cronies had failed to deliver the expected spoils of victory.  Now they were paying the price and Churchill, old words and wind, was back.     Funny really, Maurice was thinking of the Royal Photograph, a Socialist Government had planned a Great Exhibition to the past, present and future glory of Britian.  But it was a Conservative Government that would reap any benefits.     Finally, nearly six years after the end of the war, the last of rationing was swept away.  The tight reigns of control were slackened and, if the editorials in the papers were to be believed, colour and life were coming back.  Of course the Welfare State, so lauded by the Socialists, would stay.  You'd think that they'd invented it!  Maurice laughed.  That was typical of the Socialist and Communists, to claim the credit for everything.     He looked up along the tight-packed shelves of the shop towards the Marxist Section.  The backs of the inexpensive well produced Lutz Editions glinted in the morning sun.  How cleverly they had been written.  Exposing every fallacy, every false claim made by the Russians and their fellow travellers.  They sowed the seeds of doubt in the minds of their purchasers.       Those ardent young men, bearded and beretted, who came searching for truth and righteousness among the tracts and heavy turgid tomes of Marx and Lenin, few bought them.  Most bought the Lutz's: Russia Today, Experiments with Socialism, 'The Soviet Dream, The New World Tomorrow.  Best sellers, each one.  A literary Fifth Column. Undermining, weakening dreams, correcting, reseeding corrupted soil, Ernst had been right again.  For the moment, the pen would be mightier than any sword.     The shop bell clanged as the door opened.  A couple, youngish.  Maurice watched them as they wandered about.     "May I be of assistance?"  He asked.     The man looked bemused, "Er," he began.     "Avez vous une guide de Paris, s’il vous plait?"  The woman said in very bad French.     "Un plan de la ville ou une guide?" Maurice kept his amusement supressed.     The couple looked at each other.       "A map, streets," the man waved his hands ineffectually.     "I have both maps of Paris and guide books," said Maurice.     "You speak English."  The woman sounded amazed,  “And so well.”     "Thank you," Maurice's amusement was winning and the corners of a smile caught his eyes and mouth.  Did they think Europe so uncivilized?     "Hardly any one does," she went on, "It's been so difficult."     "Is this your first visit to Paris?" he asked.     "Oh, yes, it is."  The man looked about the shop.     "It has not been easy to travel… since the war," the woman had hesitated, as if it should not be mentioned outside Britain.  Especially not in once occupied areas.     "Currency restrictions," the man said with obvious disapproval, "and I'm in banking," he added inconsequentially.     "And are you enjoying Paris?"       "Definitely. Oh yes."  Their voices ran over each other.     "Perhaps," said Maurice steering them to a section by the table, "Some of these books will help you to enjoy it more."  He pulled a couple of books from the shelf. "These are both in English and French, both contain street maps."     He left their profuse words of praise at the practicability of his stock and them at the table and returned to his desk.     Violet had descended, no doubt on hearing the shop bell and assuming he needed to have an eye kept on him, now he had customers.  She was sitting on his opened catalogue and washing her face with small elegant movements.     "So now I must wait for you before I can finish," he said to her.     She looked up at him and meowed softly.    "I know, I should have done that and not read the paper."    She went back to her washing, her point made.        "You have some very interesting looking books in the area by the small window."      Maurice had forgotten the English couple, he looked up from the recently relinquished catalogue.    "I'm sorry?"  he said.    "Over there, some interesting books," the man pointed.    "Ah, yes," said Maurice. "Anthropology.”    "Yes," the man paused, "I could understand some of the titles, particularly in the adjacent section."    Maurice nodded, that was the unofficially named Kampfzeit collection.    "You don't have any in English, do you?"  The question, though innocent, was loaded.    "Alas no," Maurice made a Gallic gesture with his hands, "Sadly not."    "Ah," the man turned, as if to see if his wife was still engrossed in maps and guides.  Then he turned back to Maurice who kept his expression open, inviting continuance.    "Perhaps, should you ever, er, obtain any in translation..." He was being very careful.    "Yes," said Maurice, "I do have a mailing list."    Quickly the man drew out a pen and small pad from his inner pocket.    "My name and address," he wrote fast.    "Darling?"  The chair scrapped as she rose to come over to the desk.    Maurice took the proffered paper and slipped it under the catalogue to the immediately relieved and approving glance of the man before he turned to his wife.    "Found what you wanted, dear?"    She held a Michelin in her hand, "This one's really excellent," she enthused.    He took it from her and passed it to Maurice.    He bagged it for them and gave change.    "Please come again," he called after them as the door closed behind them.    He pulled the slip from the catalogue.    David Guthridge.      20, Oppidans Rd, Primrose Hill, London NW3.    Maurice knew the area,  but not the road.    "Primrose Hill," he said softly to himself. "You can see right over London, across Regent's Park and the Zoo, clear to St. Paul's."    As he spoke a longing smote him, tightening his chest and cascading the best of London past, his London, before his eyes.    The rest of the morning was quiet.  The afternoon made up for that.  At one point Francoise came down to help him in the shop and Violet retreated to the sanctuary of the kitchen window sill to soak up sunshine.         That night Maurice could not get to sleep.  He lay for a long while listening to the dying sounds of this city while he remembered another.  It was like making love to one person while thinking of another.   Had too much happened in the last few years?  Was the magic of Paris waning?  Perhaps he was just bored,  or tired of an undiluted diet of the French.     He turned over raising a protest from Violet who was curled up against his thigh.     He half-dozed in Holborn.  Then  walked in memory down the streets and squares of central London until, having reached Piccadilly by way of Bond Street and Oxford Street, he slept.     Getting a line to Berlin took him most of the early morning.  At last the ringing was answered.     "Lutz Publishers."     "Ulrich Lutz, please."       "Who is calling?"      "Maurice Vigor from Paris."     He was put through immediately.       "Maurice, how may I help you?"  The soft voice, ever careful of eavesdroppers, full of silent warning slipped down the line.     "Do we have any of our stock in English?" He knew he would be understood.     "Have we had enquiries?"     "Only one so far?"     "A particular title?"     "No."     "Ah," the line crackled momentarily. "I see."  There was silence and then, "No, not in English."     "Perhaps there are no outlets?"     "Perhaps not."     "Well, thank you, Ulrich."     "Thank you Maurice."     The line broke and Maurice hung up.     Two days later Maurice received a call from Ernst.  It was very brief.  He was to meet him at seven at the Hotel Colomb, room 43.          "Why did you not come to the shop?"  Maurice had spent the day in some concern that he had offended Ernst, or that he should not have made the call to Ulrich, though he called him many times before over deliveries.     "You are a worrier, old friend," said Ernst immediately dispelling Maurice's fears with his usual warm grip and smile.     "Here, a glass of schnapps before we talk."  He poured two generous measures from the bottle he had taken from his case.       "Remeber this," he raised this glass and took a sip, "from the Estate.  The first time I gave you a nip you nearly choked to death."     The lake!  Of course Maurice remembered.  He too raised his glass.  "From the estate?"  He no longer choked on schnapps.     "It has been returned to me, not all of it, but the house and most of the grounds.  I have lost the farms."     "The lake?"     "Oh yes, the lake is safe.  We will go back soon, for the old times."     They drank in memory for the old times.     "Now," Ernst lounged back in the chair, "Let us talk of new times.  You spoke to Ulrich."     Maurice related the events that precipitated his call.     Ernst nodded as he listened.     "England, England.  We have members there, a few, and some collectors as you know, but no base.  No core, and no texts in English.  You were right to alert Ulrich to that.  He called me immediately after you had spoken to him.  We are working to remedy the  deficiency immediately.  But to begin with, I am having some Canadian books sent over for you to look at."   He finished his drink and poured himself another, smaller.  "But it is the question of an outlet that matters most at the moment which is why we are here and not at the shop."     Maurice looked puzzled.     "I know Francoise is uneasy, shall we say, in my presence."  He held up his hand as Maurice went to speak.  "It is of no matter, I take no offence.  I would prefer it if it were otherwise, but I understand.  Now, I have a suggestion, which if you are willing to consider, and if you think Francoise has a role to play, would do better coming to her as if I had nothing to do with it."    He paused.      "You are right, she may resent..." He did not finish.    Ernst smiled at him.  "You would have made a good diplomat, my old friend.  Your face gives little away.  Times are changing in England.  We may even revive some pre-war friends."    "As you predicted."      "Indeed.  Now I think the climate may tolerate, need even, a bookshop."  He was watching Maurice intently as he spoke.      "I had thought that, too," said Maurice.  "Do you want me to go back to London?"    "Only if it was truely what you wanted."    Now that such a possibility existed where it had not before, Maurice was not so certain of his feelings.  Homesickness, London in the abstract was one thing; returning to live there again was another.    "I don't know," Maurice said, "but I will do all I can to help get a shop established."    Ernst nodded.  "That's good enough.  Look, why don't you go over for a holiday, say in August.  Take Francoise, too, if she wants to go.  Visit your mother, have a break.  I could make some enquiries and have lists of suitable properties available for you to perhaps look at.  Then, we can talk about it further.  What do you think?"       "I think that's good," said Maurice relieved that no absolute decision had to be made now.     "So do I.  Now, enough of business, let's go out for a meal and I'll tell you all about the beauties of Cape Town."             Maurice said nothing of the idea to Francoise for a couple of weeks.  When he did mention the possibility of taking a holiday in England she was more than agreeable.        "We could visit the Festival?"  she asked.     "Of course, anywhere you want to go."     "The Tower, Hampton Court and Stratford Avon."       "On Avon, Stratford on Avon," he corrected her.     "To see William Shakespeare play?"  She was very keen on going, much to Maurice's relief.     "Yes, that too."     Suddenly her face fell.     "No, no it is not possible, we cannot go."  She looked very close to tears.     For a moment Maurice was mystified, then it was clear.     "Violet," he said.     "La Rage, er, rabies and quarantine. She cannot come, we cannot leave her, we cannot go."       Maurice was ashamed he had not thought of Violet in his own excitement.  He had thought of her as being with them, he had forgotten the channel.    "We can shut the shop, August is poor for business anyway, and we can get someone to look after her."    Francoise looked at him, uncertain.    "Yes," she said at last, "But not anyone, it must be the right person.  Someone Violet likes."    So it was agreed.  They would go, if, only if the right person could be found.  That was a task that Francoise took upon herself.     Funny, thought Maurice, this was the first time Francoise had taken the initiative in anything.  Good old Violet.    The right person was found within a week, a pale-faced girl who was reading philosophy at the Sorbonne.  Maurice had seen her in the shop a few times, but it was Francoise who had approached her.  She had been introduced to Violet who appeared to approve. A good stock of salmon and ham had been laid in and all instructions given.  Meanwhile Maurice had booked the flight to Heathrow, arranged, with assistance from a friend of Ernst's, a passport for Francoise and had booked them a hotel just off Bloomsbury  Square.  Things could not have gone smoother.    The next couple of weeks dragged.  Then time accelerated and they were unpacking in the hotel room.  Their second room.  The first had only a double bed.  Luckily, there was a twin bedded room on the same floor with the same view.      "The British Museum?"  Francoise was pointing out of the window.    Maurice looked out.  One large roof looked like any other, but it was in the right direction.  "Yes, I think so,” he said.    "Then we can go?"      So far, apart from a less than jovial greeting by Immigration for Francoise, she was entranced by what little of London she had seen.    Her delight with Maurice's city grew day by day.  She wore him out with questions and demands to see everything.  And through showing her, Maurice saw London again.  A different London to the one he had known as a younger man. Now he had money, and the war had softened the class divisions.  Pounds now opened doors previously closed except to breeding.  But the scars were everywhere, hardened by time and lack of money into overgrown bomb sites, shored buildings, missing landmarks and gaunt empty spaces.  There were new buildings, and evidence of repair, but there was an inescapable air of loss,  irreparable loss, coupled with an insidious lack of will to repair it.  As if, by some concensus, it was agreed that it was impossible to recover what had been lost.  The price for victory, paid over the six long years of war, had been too high.  The wealth, the tradition, even the Empire had gone or would have to go.  And even that might not be enough.  Yet, London chastened was more attractive to Maurice than London arrogant.         They called briefly one afternoon on Aunt Lara and Maurice's mother.  Whatever difficulties there may have been were swept aside by his mother's realisation that Francoise was female.  Told by a neighbour and believed for the last five years that it was a man's name, she had never spoken of it to her sister, nor mentioned it to Maurice in her few letters.  Now, as Maurice knew, Francoise could do no wrong and was welcomed with opened arms and every nicety.  The next day they planned to shop.  For this, Maurice was not needed and he was told so.  With just the right amount of reluctance he agreed.       With Oxford Street their first stop, and the meeting place agreed that evening, he set off for the Commercial Agent Ernst had recommended he try.     Maurice knew the area he thought would be best.  Close to the West End, well served with transport, near to the intelligentsia of Hampstead and Belsize Park, yet not too obvious.  The Agent flicked through files.       "Are you here for long, Mr. Vigor?" he asked.     "I have all day," said Maurice.     This was somewhat less time than the Agent had in mind.  However, it was already established that money was not a problem.  The office and others could wait.  The Agent was a man who believed in making hay while the sun shone.  A buyer from abroad with money and a clear idea of what he wanted was a very bright sun.  In moments they were in his car and off.     By lunchtime, Maurice had seen and dismissed five properties.     "Perhaps Camden Town, sir.  It's a little shabby, but it has great charm."     Maurice shrugged.  He would see.     They pulled up and parked in the yard of some half-empty warehouses by the bank of the Regent canal and crossed the iron bridge into Camden High Street.     "It was a furniture shop originally.  It's been empty for some time, but a very sound building.  Northern line station just up the road and plenty of busses."  The Agent pulled out the plans and the description. "I have the keys with me."     Maurice nodded his assent.     They crossed the road and walked toward the Oxford Arms and there it was.  Almost an exact replica of the shop in the Rue de la Chat Qui Peche.  A large empty room downstairs.  Above two floors, easily convertible to accommodation.  By the few fittings left in the rooms it was possible that once they had been just that.  A small backyard and a way out to the canal bank. A cellar, dry and cavernous.     The Agent went on at length and Maurice let him talk.   He had made his decision.  Finally Maurice interrupted the flow.     "It's nearly two.  I could do with a bite to eat."  he said.     The Oxford Arms served rolls and beer, English beer from the wood.  His task completed Maurice enjoyed both.  Then, putting the Agent out of his misery, he lent forward.     "The furniture shop, at the right price I would be interested."     The haggling did not take long.     "If you could leave a deposit, sir, and if I could have the name of your solicitor?"  Happiness shone from the Agent's face.  There was a good commission on this sale.     For a moment Maurice was at a loss, he had no English Solicitor.  He thought hard.  Who did he know who may help?  Then he remembered the English couple in the shop and the address. The man had said he was in banking.  What bank?  Maurice concentrated.  William Glynns Bank.  The name had been on the top of the notepad slip the man had given him.       He excused himself and went to the phone.  Four branches were listed.  The second try was successful.  Regents Park Branch was managed by David Guthridge.  He asked to be put through to him.  The explanation for the call did not take long.  He was remembered, and yes, Mr. Guthridge would be delighted to help.  The Bank's solicitor could handle the details and, of course, the bank could facilitate any monies and transfers of funds that were needed.     By just after three, Maurice and the Agent were let into the now closed bank.  By four, the details were completed.  Papers would be sent to Paris, and within a few weeks at most the shop would be his.  Before he left, Maurice made a small deposit to open an account, more would be transfered later.  Hands were shook and the business was done.  All were pleased.  (Although the still happy Agent did indicate that such speed was most un-English, however that was by the by.)     By five, Maurice was sitting in Lyons Corner House, tea ordered, as the be-bagged and weary three deposited their purchases around the table and joined him.     All to soon for Francoise the holiday was over and they were back in Paris.      Within days it was as if they had never been away, yet changes, subtle at first, had been wrought in their lives and relationship.      Violet, initially angry with him for abandoning her, decided that she would not let Maurice out of her sight.  She took to climbing from his lap onto his shoulder where she would then drap herself round his neck and hang on like a living stole.  Up and down stairs, in the shop, even while he ate she clung to him.  She was determined he would not leave her again.      So, cat-draped, he sat at his desk and wrote out a report on the shop, on his impression of London now, and on his feelings about returning to England.  In many ways his brief return had created an ambiguity  that was difficult to define.  Compared to Paris, London was drab, tight and insular.  The temporary cosmopolitan atmosphere engendered by the war had faded as the Yanks, Australians, Kiwis, Canadians, and Empire soldiers had gone home. So, too, had many of the emigres.  The unity of purpose had not survived the peace and socialism. The old, though weakened divisions, had returned.     Yet seeing it again had awoken his Englishness and Paris appeared more foreign to him now.  So much had happened here, perhaps too much.       However, the greatest change, and that which made the final decision, was not in him.  It was in Francoise.  It was as if London had opened her as sunshine opens a flower.  She bloomed on foreign soil and saw there what Maurice had once seen in Paris.  There was hope and, she believed, limitless possibilities.  Untainted with Englishness she yearned for England.  She fought with her accent, hoarded her vocabulary and refused to speak French to Maurice demanding he correct her every mistake.  She began to assert a will he had not previously suspected she possessed.     If Ernst wanted him to return, he would.  When Ernst finally rang, he told him so.  The die was cast again.     Ernst and he sat at the desk, blinds drawn, the shop shut.  Papers lay scattered about the desk.  There was much to arrange, but no obvious problems.     "So you are happy with this?"  Ernst needed to be sure of Maurice's decision.     "Yes, on balance it is best."  Maurice moved their glasses.  "I can sell, or transfer the Les Halles shop to whomever you suggest.  I have already had enquiries about the shop in Nice."     Ernst raised his head.  "From whom?"     "Udo Bruker, he was with the Afrika Corps, wounded, Iron Cross, a comrade and now a military historian.  He wants to build up that side of things.  He made an offer over a year ago."  Maurice had liked the man the first time he had met him.     Ernst nodded slowly.  "Does he know about you?"     Maurice smiled, "No, I am just a bookseller."     Ernst tapped his fingers on the desk for a moment, "Is he a resident?"     "His home was in the East, now he lives permanently in Nice, he has good local contacts."  Maurice had checked on that.     "I cannot place the name," said Ernst frowning slightly.     Maurice pulled an old catalogue from the file and ran his finger down the list of names.  "Here, look, he is one of Fritsch's group."        "Then there should be no problem, but I would like to be sure."     "Of course," said Maurice.         "And what of this shop?"  Ernst looked round, "Your home."      "You or I can find the right buyer," Maurice felt a twinge of sadness as he spoke.      "And in London, the building is only a shell. How will you manage at first?"  There was concern in Ernst's words.      "I can take a room, have the work done. There are plenty of sales, particularly of libraries from some of the gentry fallen on hard times.  Ordinary stock will not be a problem."  Maurice had thought it through.      "Neither will our stock be.  Lutz is printing English editions and they can be shipped to you as soon as you are ready."  He paused, "And you are happy to cultivate what sympathisers and comrades you can, in your own country?"      "It will be slow work, but I am content if you are."      Ernst smiled at him, "The slowest work is often the longest lasting. I am content too."     "What of Francoise?"  asked Ernst suddenly.      "To say that she was obsessed with London and English would be an understatement," said Maurice wearily.     "There would be a problem with her status, she has no trade or profession."  He steepled his fingers.  "The best she could obtain would be temporary residence.  England is not as ameneable to these things as France.  Of course she could remain here," he paused, "Unless you want her."     Maurice felt he had been placed on a spot that he would sooner have avoided had it been possible to do so.     "I am fond of her, she is useful..." he began.     Ernst looked straight at him, "Of course, she could just… go away."     Maurice shuddered inwardly and shook his head.  He knew exactly what Ernst meant.  Tidy, convenient, but he knew he could not live with an other 'accident' even if not directly of his making.     "Then I have another suggestion, perhaps almost as unpalatable to you, and one that may have personal repercussions which one would not wish either.  Although in England a wife for you would not be without advantages."  Ernst's eyes did not leave Maurice's face.    Maurice felt more than uncomfortable, his hands grew damp and his mouth dried, but he was past blushing.  This was the first time that Ernst had ever referred to his sexual tastes so openly, although without any hint of censure.     "A marriage of convenience," Maurice managed to say, his voice as neutral as he could manage.    "It is not uncommon in such circumstances."    Did Ernst mean to homosexuals or to those seeking safe domicile in another Country, or both?    "How would Francoise feel about this?" Ernst continued.    Maurice shook his head, "I don't know."    "Perhaps if it was put to her as the only way, and if she is as keen on England as you say, then it may be acceptable to her."    Considering the possible alternative Maurice had little choice.  He nodded.  "I will speak to her," he said.    "Good,"  Ernst was smiling at him, "Then I think we have covered all that is necessary."     It was only after Ernst had returned to his hotel that Maurice realised that the shop in Angoulime had not been mentioned.  It could not have been forgotten.  He thought hard. Had he ever mentioned that he had bought it, did Ernst know of its existence?  He must know, surely.  The last of the cases from Lutz were stored at Angoulime.  Ernst had never asked where.  Maurice kept no records of the Angoulime shop, the deeds were still held by the notary, the quaterly rent went to a small bank in Angoulime and then by occasional regular transfer to his personal Paris account.  Ernst could not know.     He must tell him.     But why, thought Maurice, did Ernst need to know?  The shop sold only ordinary books, paid him very little rent, and surely was of no use to the organisation.  Also it was his.  One place, one thing that was his and his alone.  Despite the bad memories of Angoulime, there was the balm, the anodyne of that little shop and the memory of the old bookseller.     He would say nothing.  That was no betrayal.     The first problem he had to face was Francoise.  He had to tell her he was moving to London.  He put it off, knowing she wanted to go, but afraid of how she would respond to Ernst's solution to residence.  His prevarication and fear were to no point.     On Maurice's return from two days in Nice,  that came after the days on the telephone to Udo Brucker, Francoise confronted him.     "You are going back to London, no?"     "Yes," he could not deny it.     "You are selling the other shops?"     "Yes," he could not deny that either.     "And you will not come back to France?"     He was not sure, but it was not likely and he said so.     "I will come with you."  She stood in front of him, hands on her hips. "I have nothing here."     He spoke of the problem of permanent residence, she nodded.     "Then we will marry."  Said, matter of fact.     "But," he wanted to say he did not love her, could not love her, but she knew that.     "What does that matter?  It is convenient, we will be just as we are here, no?"     And so that too was decided, and settled.       But not by his will or volition.          Maurice paced up and down the room.  Frustration and the forced intimacy of their small flat was driving him mad.  London was so overcrowded.  But he had never expected the fitting out of the shop to take so long or there to be so many bureaurocratic delays.  Had he had the slightest indication of this when they had arrived last October he would have taken something larger despite the cost.     His obvious mood and agitation was annoying Violet and she was meowing with her own dissatisfaction.  He sat down and she jumped onto his lap.  At least they had avoided quarantine, thanks to Ernst and a Bretton fishing boat.  He ran his hands over her coat and she began to purr softly.     Would the new window for the shop get here today?  And if it did, would it be fitted properly?  It had been promised in December, but of course, the Christmas holidays, men were sick, the cold, the rain, excuses and excuses.  Still, much had been achieved.  The living quarters above the shop were nearly complete.  When Francoise got back from the doctor they would go to Heals and spend more money.  He wished now he hadn't insisted that all the profits from the sale of the three shops go to the Phoenix Organisation.  Not that it was really his anyway.  Neither did he much like the man who had taken over the his shop in the Rue de la Chat Qui Peche,  and he couldn't stand his wife, opinionated busybody.     He wasn't too keen on his own wife either, come to that.  It was funny how a simple ceremomy and a piece of paper could change someone.  He much preferred the Francoise of old, difficult as she could be.  This new Francoise took marriage to mean far more than he had been led to believe.  'Continue as we are', she'd said, but obviously had not meant.  She wanted to know everything he was doing.  Where he went to buy books, why it took two days when it could have been done in one.   Why did they have to stock those books, by which she meant the three large cases of Lutz editions that were already in the Camden basement awaiting shelves.  How much money had they?  Luckily he had never shown her more than the shop account transfered from Paris.     And there were the domestic arrangements.  He winced inwardly.  Why had he agreed,  even worse, participated in the banal pretence of normality?       Oh damn it all!  They couldn't even get a phone in the flat.  At least businesses took priority and he had one in the shop.  He stood up, and Violet immediately took the seat.  He would go to the shop where he could breathe. He wrote a quick note for Francoise.  She could meet him there.     By the time he had walked along the canal from Baynes' Street he felt better.  The Glaziers and the decorators were there.       "Be in by t'night guv."  As it was already actually in the frame and the boards taken down, he believed them.     Upstairs the kitchen and front room were finished.  He climbed the last flight to the bedroom.  Pots of paint were stacked in the corner, the ceiling was half done, but there was no sign of men.  He went down to the shop again.  There in the back, where his desk would go they were drinking tea and smoking.      "Be done by this afternoon, cleared out tomorrow," the foreman had anticipated his question.  He stubbed his cigarette on the floor,  "Just a quick break."     By the number of stubbed cigarettes they hadn't even started today's work.     Maurice said nothing, flicked on the light and went down into the cellar.  He may as well check through his boxed purchases ready for the job of shelving once he had the place to himself.  He took the sheaves of paper from the box where he had left them and continued listing the novels.      He managed an hour in this underworld of which he was the sole custodian before he heard the belling of the telephone and the shouted summons.       They would meet at Heals, Francoise would prefer to go straight there rather than via the shop.  He was soon to discover why, though he had not been curious.     Francoise accompanied by the ever-attentive salesman noting their selections, waited until they reached the bedroom furniture before she spoke of her visit to the doctors.  She took Maurice to one side.     "There is room for twin beds?" she asked.     He was sure there was.     "I know you prefer that, and as we have the choice now."     Maurice was relieved.     "And is there room, too, for a cot?"     His mind froze.     She took his arm, "I am going to have a baby, the doctor is certain."     "When?"  His voice no more than a whisper, his mind staggering back from the edge of some great void.     "June, he thinks."     She had waited to tell him until they were in public, she had wanted no scene.     He nodded numbly.     Francoise went over to the salesman and drew him toward the single beds talking as she walked with him.       Maurice, alone, grasped at everything and nothing. He was to be a father.  No, no, Francoise was to be a mother and the more he thought that the more he believed it had been her plan for some time.  This was no accident, no unlucky quirk of fate.  This was her intent.  Once she knew he was going back to England, she had suggested marriage.  She had led him on with her weakness.  She had beguiled him, bound him and won.  All his domination, all her submission had been her will, not his.  Tears; shame and nausea surged within him.          The shop opened two weeks later.  Maurice had said no more to Francoise about her pregnancy.  There was no more to say.     A bottle of champagne arrived from Ernst and an encouraging telegram wishing him all success.  He spent long hours in the shop.  Francoise stayed upstairs, or went out for walks or shopping.  They spoke little more than was demanded by the ordinary needs of domesticity.       As the child grew within her so the gulf between them grew.  Whatever affection there may have been, whatever understanding crumbled like a child's sandcastle before a rising tide.  Francoise became stronger, more certain of herself and the life she now wanted.  It would not include Maurice.  He had played his role, she was grateful, but he was not to be a parent.  She had calculated everything.  It was, she said, for the best.     And despite all, in his heart he agreed with her.       Once certain of his agreement she spared time to comfort him with assurances and to draw up the contract of colusion and silence between them.     She would never speak of Ernst, nor of Lutz, not even whisper what she did not know but suspected.  She did not care what they had done or may do.  The child expunged her past, her pain, with its birth she would be reborn.     For his part he would give her enough money to manage after the birth and if she sent for it, small sums until she was sufficiently independent.  They did not discuss divorce.     "Will you tell the child of me?" he asked.     She shook her head.  "I will say you died before he was born."     His own childhood stood mocking him from the wings of history.  But his child would be no bastard.     "How will you live?"     "I will find the post of housekeeper where a child is welcomed."     She stood up heavily and went into the kitchen.  He sat looking out into the night.  She returned placing a cup of tea by his chair.     "When I go into the hospital I shall not come back here.  It will then be adieu."  She rested her hand on his head for a long while and then went up to her bed.     One month later she left.                          August 4th. 1989	‘Some love is fire: some love is rust.	But the fiercest, cleanest love is lust.’		Matthew put the book down on the bedside table, changed his mind, opened the drawer and slipped it, for protection, inside.  Coffee stains on one of only 750 copies of the 1928 Pascal Covini edition of Joseph Moncure Marsh’s The Wild Party, would not enhance its value.  Mind you, value apart, this was a beautiful book.  He was beginning to appreciate the allure of the antiquarian book trade.		“I’m nearly done, shall I leave it running?”  Jenny’s voice called up from the bathroom.	“Yes,” He swung himself out of bed and threw back the sheets to air.	He pulled his dressing gown around him and squeezed out of the room.  The new bed was supposed to be a double though it was more like a compromise.  It just fitted into the room and two could sleep in it side by side as long as neither craved space to spread out.  Still, despite her clothes in the wardrobe, Jenny only stayed three or four nights each week which made sex more regular and bed size less a contention.		“Pass me the towel.”	He handed her a clean one from the pile on the chair and she stepped out of the shower.	“Join me for a quick splash?”	“Later,” she began to dry herself.	The non-mist shaving mirror, misted, giving him a cataract reflection, but good enough to see where his nose and eyes were,  he squirted the foam from the can.	“I’ll put the coffee on and then open up.  Bring me a cup down, will you?”	He peaked out of the curtain.  She was bending over to feed her left foot into a stocking and the thin silk of her briefs stretched tight over her buttocks.  He felt lust stir and he tried to concentrate on his shaving.  He heard her zip her dress and then clatter down to the kitchen.  He sighed.  When she allowed sex, they had sex; when he wanted sex, it depended.  Jenny appeared able to compartmentalize everything.  Anyone seeing them in the shop would never think they were lovers of eight months standing - just an owner and his employee with no more than a profit and wage connection.	He rinsed the shampoo from his hair, dried and returned to the bedroom to dress.	In the kitchen the coffee was percolating and O.C. was contentedly eating his breakfast.  He poured two cups, a touch of milk in both, turned the gas off and made his way carefully down the stairs and into the shop.  They had a customer already and Jenny was with him in the new novels section so he sat at the desk and began to go through the part opened post.  So far only the ususal bills, plus a request for a book and a cheque for a book dispatched.  He slit the next envelope and a photo dropped out.  He sat looking at it.  Black and white, old.  He turned it over in his hand, nothing on the back.  No note, nothing.  The shop bell clanked departure.	“No sale.  Got the coffee?”  Jenny joined him at the desk.	“What do you make of this?”   The postmark was local.	“It’s Maurice.”	“I know.”	“Paris, remember, Spring 1938, that entry about him and Ernst when the king visited.”	“I remember, but who and why?”	“I’m not a mind reader, certainly not at a distance.” Jenny was obviously not in a good mood.  “The who has to be Ernst, but the why and why now is beyond me.’	“Perhaps he just came on it.”	“From what you told me about Herr Todt ,that is unlikely.  He is not the kind of man who just comes on things.  You know, he does look like you.”	“Maurice?”	“Well obviously not Ernst.”	“It’s a good photo of him.”	Jenny nodded, “What’s in the rest of the mail?”	Matthew slit the letters and Jenny spilled out their contents.	“Catalogue, catalogue, solicitor, bank,” she said.	“Solicitor first, may as well get the nasties over,” said Matthew reaching for the proffered letter.	“It’s your solicitor.”	“Does that make a difference?” Matthew read the letter. “Decree nisi and property settlement, absolute in six weeks. Looks like that’s it.  Seems he was right, she was in a hurry.”	“Probably pregnant by the boyfriend,” said Jenny brutally.	Matthew just shrugged, he didn’t care anymore.	“Well,” Jenny continued, “that means you will get your half of the flat sale, and, unless you’ve other ideas, some could go on stock.”	He had never mentioned Maurice’s savings account and he still was not going to, though even to himself he could not satisfactorily explain why that was.  “Okay, you’ll get your new stock.”	“It’s your shop, Matthew, and unless you start getting some modern novels, and before you say anything I don’t mean twentieth century, I mean 1989, you’ll lose the few young buyers that do come in.”	Matthew sighed. Jenny had been on the ‘modernize or perish’ track for the last six months.  “Get the lists, look at what you think will sell, and then we can price it out.”	“You know I’m right, Matthew,” her tone now concilliatory and soft. “This is a good shop. Maurice had an eye for old books, but most of the drop-in trade wants modern, then they may see something classic and buy that, too.”	“Two birds one stone?”	She looked at him, “Well, with imagination someone may see it that way.”  She passed him the bank statement.	He passed it back, “Shop account, that’s your territory.”  He had told the bank to hold statements on the savings account and she never opened his personal bank account or letters.	“Todays the sale of antiquarin books at Ridges, you going?”	He left the catalogue upstairs.  They’d been through it yesterday evening and had marked a few with the prices they would go to.	“Think I’m up to it?”	“Time you went solo.”  She smiled at him. “You’ll be fine, just don’t get carried away.”	“What time was the viewing?”	“Eleven and the sale at two, you could have lunch by the river.”	“I’ll get the catalogue and just run through it again.  More coffee?”	“Please.”	He took the cups and went upstairs.	Funny, he thought, how life turns out.  Today would be his first auction on his own.  No longer a teacher, now a book-seller.  Well, that was not strictly true - he was on half pay pending the final medical report for stress related breakdown.  Just as well.  Lving on the shop profit after paying Jenny would not be easy. He poured two cups and put the percolator on the side.  Dr. Hamilton had been wonderful, right report, sensible and sympathetic psychiatrist and, with luck, there’d be a lump sum and a pension for life.  Neither large, but nice to have all the same.	He picked up the auction catalogue.  Why the photo and why now?  The thought chased round his head.  But finding not even the hint of a possible explanation, it made do with settling in a corner like an irritating itch while he made his way back down to the shop. 		Lunch at the Rose looking out from the old wooden balcony at the silver grey waters of the Thames put Matthew in mind of the beginning of Heart of Darkness, now that was a book he wouldn’t mind owning in a first edition.  He’d marked two more books and what he thought was a fair price beside them in the catalogue from his morning’s viewing and he had to admit he felt ready for the fray.  He finished the half pint and pondered the thought of a second; there was still a piece of pie to wash down.  He half-turned to see if the bar was crowded.	“You buying for Vigor’s?”	He turned back to look at the man who addressed him.	“Yes,” Matthew said.	“Thought that’s what I heard you say to the girl.  Name’s Polk, John Polk, took the liberty of getting you a half.”	He put the half and his own on the table and drew up a chair, “D’you mind?”	He shook his head, “No, do sit. Vigor, Matthew Vigor.”	They shook hands, part rising, but not standing, and then sitting back.	“Vigor, related to old Maurice?”	“Yes,” said Matthew.	“Thought you must be, silly to ask with the same name.  Sorry to read about his passing.”	“Thank you.”	“Must miss him in the shop, bloody good he was.”	“Yes, Jenny often reminds me of that.”	“Young girl, long hair, bit fierce, reads German?”	“That’s her, though not fierce.”	“She could be if you tried to outbid her,”  The man laughed.  “So how’s business?”	“Slowish, but better than no business.”  Matthew felt at a disadvantage.  He didn’t recognize the name, yet the man had known his father and Jenny.	“Still in the special books market?”  The man spoke softly part masking his words with the glass.	Matthew’s gut twisted suddenly.  What special books? Did he mean those for Julien, or the far right wing?  	“Not as much,” he answered evasively.	“Pity, I’ve got hold of some really explosive stuff,” he bent to his briefcase.	“Not here,” Matthew hissed at him.	“Oh, I suppose not,”  John Polk sat up and looked round. “Well, if you’ve got a few minutes after the sale we could look at them then.”	“Yes,” said Matthew hoping Polk may have forgotten by then, or that they would miss each other in the rush to leave.  For a moment he contemplated forgoing the auction altogether.  	But it was not to be.  Polk stayed with him.  After lunch they went in to do their bidding.	Matthew gained three of his ticked books at less than the price he had been willing to pay, lost one and paid ten pounds more for the last one getting caught up in the excitement.  On balance he had done well and was pleased.  He knew he would show a fair profit when these sold and he already had a possible buyer for one of them.		“Well, that was fun,”  Polk grinned having bought a whole collection of Kipling firsts at a knock down price.  “Politically unsound at the moment, but once a great, and he’ll be great again,”  He laughed.  “One could say that about quite a few people.”  He looked carefully at Matthew who managed a convincing nod of agreement.   “Look, what you say we drop in a place I know nearby where the atmosphere is far more conducive to our business.  You car or tube?”	“Tube.”	“Well, makes more sense in central London, bloody parking’s impossible.  I’m out in Bishops Stortford now.  Nice place, price of success,”  he laughed.  “Bastard driving in though.  So my car it is, just round the corner.”	Matthew followed like a leashed dog unable to think of a convincing way out of the tryst.  They drove toward Elephant and Castle, then Polk turned off and swung into a maze of high rise flats.	“Great place this is.  See the police and the special branch long before they get to you.  Blacks have the same idea.”  Matthew must have looked a little blank, Drugs,” Polk added.  	As they parked a black kid ran up, “Watch yer car.”	It was not a question.	“Fuck off,” said Polk and hit the horn in a quick staccato..	Two men appeared, young, shaven heads, in jeans, long boots and biker jackets.	“Seeing Mr. Christian.”  Polk said.	“Right,” said the more articulate one leaning against the bonnet and beginning to roll a cigarette.  The other just stood looking at Matthew.	“Six flights and no lift, keeps you fit,” said Polk.	They knocked on the door of the flat and waited while the bolts were drawn back.	“Johnny, good to see you,”  the speaker looked at Matthew.	“He’s okay, said Polk, “Old Vigor’s son.”	“Come in.”	The door closed and bolted behind them.	“Pleased to meet you. David Pierce.”	“Matthew Vigor,”  He shook the proffered hand.  The man was in his mid-fifties at a guess, well spoken, well built and looked fit.  He was smartly dressed, shirt and tie, pressed cavalry twills and had something about him that made Matthew think of the military.	He led the way into the sitting room and waved them to a couch.  He stood in front of them, his back to the mantlepiece.  Above it was a large portrait of Hitler that drew Matthew’s stare and some relief.	“Nice one isn’t it?  Got it from a friend in the State’s who brought it from Germany just after the war.  Genuine oils, copied from a photo though.”  He sounded disappointed that Hitler had not sat for it personally.   “So what brings you here?”	“Wanted to show Matthew the latest stuff in peace,” said Polk opening his case and spreading the books and magazines across the floor.  “All imports, some from Europe, most from the States.”	“They’re well ahead of us,” said Pierce, “thanks to the right to bear arms and the N.R.A.”	“We’ll not do so bad if it comes to it,” said Polk. “There’s plenty of sympathy in the police and military, especially if things get worse.”	“Look round,” said Pierce. “See them getting any lighter?”	Both men laughed.	“This is the best,” Polk handed Matthew a magazine.  “Expose from the highest sources, shows how the Jews have a stranglehold on the Democratic party.  You’ll see, next they’d be all over the White House.”	“Them and the blacks with all this affirmative action,” said Pierce.	“There’s an article on that, too, big move to change that policy.”	“‘About time, you know I read that Oxford and Cambridge are going to make it easier for them to get in.  Go to a black doctor and they can hardly speak English.”	“Sooner die first.” said Polk.	“Die if you saw one,” said Pierce.	Matthew flipped at the magazine disbelieving his eyes and his ears.  	“Books here on militia, two on scientific proof of racial inferiority.”  He looked at Matthew. “No one liked what the RuSHA came up with under Himmler, but now there’s real proof.”  He passed Matthew a thick book.  “Written by a doctor and an anthropologist.”	Matthew studied the contents and then flipped through the pages of graphs and reputed case studies.	“Looks good,” he said.	“Right then, put you down for half a dozen, and say, twenty copies of the mag?   Couple each of the rest?”	“Well...,” said Matthew,  “We’re not getting a lot of demand...”	“This is not the usual pulp stuff - it’s quality, sort of thing you should have, that’ll attract the customer, you’ll see.”	“I’ll put the word round at the meetings,” said Pierce,  “I go to a lot of colleges, talk on military history, cultural revival, that sort of thing.  There’s a lot of interest in it, you know.”	“Bloody ought to be unless you’re happy with this leftish liberal bend over backwards and fuck me attitude just because we once had an Empire and you were slaves.”  The venom in his voice seared the words into Matthew’s brain.	A phone rang and Pierce picked a Motorola up from the sideboard.  A long box was attached to the back of it.	“Scrambler,” he said, “this one’s bugged,” he pointed to the domestic phone on the wall. He walked into the kitchen and spoke quietly.	“Can’t even have privacy in your own home,” said Polk.  “This country has gone to the dogs.  Well, I’d better go.” He looked at his watch, “Got a date in two hours and the A10 is murder at this hour.”  He stuffed the samples back into his bag.  “Shop same address?”	Matthew nodded.	“Deliver in a week or so.”	They passed the kitchen where Pierce was still talking.  He threw a quick right arm salute and followed them to the door, bolting it behind them.	“That man’s going to be an area leader one day,” said Polk as they pulled away,  		“Elephant tube okay?” 	“Fine,” said Matthew glad to be out of his company and beginning to understand why there was so little resistance to the Nazis once they had power.  No one wants to be the one to have their head kicked in however good the cause.  You just hope you won’t have to get involved.  He’d thought it was over, but it wasn’t. He was involved and on too many levels and he wasn’t sure how to get out.			 	 	August 14th. and 15th. 1989			The intercom in the lounge buzzed and Jenny’s voice drew him from the paper.	“There’s a C.O.D. parcel from Bishops Stortford, one hundred and eighty-seven pounds thirty pence to pay.  Do you know about it?”	“Be right down,” he threw the paper to the floor making O.C. jump.  The headline blazed out at him.  ‘East Germans flee to Hungary seeking asylum in West German Embassies.’  “Asylum is what I’m going to need in a minute,” he told O.C., “when she finds out what’s in the parcel.”	He clattered down the stairs.  Could he refuse it?  But with what consequences?	“Personal,” he said, taking out his cheque book and paying the postman.	Jenny raised her eyes inquisitive.	Customers and mundane post kept her question unasked for the next couple of hours.	“So, are you going to put them on the shelves?”  She asked when he finished a somewhat bumbling explanation of the parcel.	“No,” he said.	“Why not?”	“Well,...”	“Well what?  You left the others out and you sell Marxist and left wing books.”	“These seem more extreme.”	“So, this is a bookshop and people come here to buy books, left, right and fiction.”	“I don’t sell porn and they are books.”	“Weak argument. Porn is illegal, or rubbish.  These are well produced books and they are not illegal.  And if that man Pierce recommends you to college students you’ll probably end up selling other books as well.  This is a business Matthew and you have to make a living.”	“You don’t object?”	“No, everyone is entitled to their view in a democracy as long as it is inside the law. Did you think I would object?”	“Yes.”	Jenny smiled at him, “Thanks for caring, but I don’t.  Put them on the shelves.”	Matthew had most of them out when Jenny came over to him.	“Lunch in twenty minutes.  Do you want me to make sandwiches or something?”	“Please, I’m starving.”	She looked at him, “You know, Matthew, you really ought to work out your beliefs. You can’t be a liberal in the middle forever.  Your father made his choice and lived by it, whatever regrets he may or may not have had.”	“You don’t inherit beliefs,” said Matthew.  He could smell her perfume.	She shook her head, “No, you think them out and you test them.  You can’t be an observer all your life, what everyour preferences.”  She gave him a very wicked smile and sauntered to the flat door clicking it softly behind her.	He looked after her.  What was she up to now and why?  		Some at least was made clear when he locked the shop and climbed the stairs to the kitchen.  The coffee was on and two plates of sandwiches were on the table.  Jenny was in her bathrobe.	“I have need of a super man.”	“Superman or a hard man,” he caught her round the waist.	“Both, tie me up.”	A surge of lust tore through him and he held her arms as he kissed her.	“Now, there’s rope in the bedroom.”	He pulled her up the stairs behind him.  Lengths of rope were already attached to the head and foot of the bed.	“You’ve been busy.” 	“Now it’s your turn,”  she threw herself face down on the bed.  He quickly fastened her hands and then each leg to the bottom posts.	She was still wearing stockings under the robe as he pulled it up, caressed her buttocks and struggled with his belt and zipper.  Freed at last he began to stroke her, exciting them both.  He lay on top of her his hand guiding where it had previously probed.  He entered her with a sigh and began to move slowly.	“Now stop,” she said.	He did so.	“Matthew, do what you want.”	“I want to please you.”	“You will if you do what you want.”	He reentered her and moved faster.	“This alright?”	“Shut up and do it.”	“I don’t want to hurt you.”	“For christ sake, Matthew.”	The phone rang and he broke rhythm. 	“Guilt?” she asked, “or are you thinking of answering it.”	“What’s up with you today Jenny?”	“I just want you to be you and stop trying to please everyone all the time.  You and your, ‘must do this, must do that’  attitude.”	Collapsing, he slipped out of her.	“I don’t..” 	“Yes you do and worse still you resent it.  You resented it when you were a teacher, you resented it with Susan and you resent it with me.  You wouldn’t tell Polk to stuff his books if you didn’t want them and you tried to hide them from me when you let him push them on you.  Untie me.”	She sat up on the bed.	“What is it with you?  You afraid of taking a risk, making a stand, or don’t you really have an opinion?  So you’re annoyed, I can see it in your face and yet I’d let you tie me up.  Why?  Sure I like it, but also because I know you wouldn’t do anything even if you were really mad because you’re consequence-controlled.” 	“What?”	“You try and end game, guess out the consequences, and if it looks as if it won’t cause too many problems for you, you do it.  Or from what I’ve seen of you, let it happen to you.”	“That’s not true.”	“Yes it is, you dance to other people’s tunes and you resent it.”  She got up and pulled the robe about her.	“So you want me to force you?”	“No, but if that is what you wanted you should do it and take the consequences, or better in this case, not do it and accept that you chose not to.  Can’t you see I’m just trying to give you a practical illustration?”	Matthew said nothing, but feeling silly he pulled on his trousers.	“And don’t pout like a hard done by no one understands me kid.  And yes, this may cost me my job and our relationship, but at least I’ve said what I believe.  So does Todt and even Zollman, and like them or not, you have to respect them.”	With that she went down into the bathroom and left him staring out of the window.		Matthew mouched about the flat for the next couple of hours leaving Jenny in the shop.  The phone jarred him out of his shallow self-reflection.	“Harry Frank of Lettersby and Gill.  Good afternoon, Mr. Vigor.  Good news.  I’ve just heard that the probate in your case has been settled.  The deeds of the property, the bank accounts and other goods, a deposit box if I remember, can now be passed over to you to do with as you wish.”	“That’s it?’	“Yes, that’s it.  I can fax the documents to your bank if you wish to confirm the release. The deeds of course will have to be reassigned for the property register, but we can do that in my office.  Do you have a preference for a time to call in?”	Matthew didn’t.	“Shall we say tomorrow at ten?  It won’t take long and then you can go straight to the bank.  If I get through to them in time they will have the deposit box ready. I don’t believe they returned it to store knowing this would happen eventually.”	“Thank you, ten is fine.”	“Excellent.  I’m sorry that it has taken so long, but that’s the law, same in Dicken’s time, eh?”	“It would appear so,” said Matthew. “Thanks again.” 	He sat down, now it was real, he had fourty-three thousand in the bank and he owned a bookshop and this flat.  God knows what it was worth now.  He was, well, if not rich, at least comfortable.  He sat for a while.  Yes, he would donate the Simms papers to the college; he’d write to Dr.Lester and tell him.  That should make him happy.  He’d keep the dagger with the journals and their translation that Jenny had finally typed up into a small book,  except for three or four entries or parts where time and obscurity still defied meaning.  And the Chasseur  shall be returned to Zollman. That left only one mystery still to solve and with the probate papers he now had the key:  Angoulime.	He made coffee and thought about taking a cup down to the shop, but his ego still smarted despite the good news from Harry Frank.	“I wonder if Jenny will come up before she goes?” he asked O.C. but no answer was forthcoming.  He was pretty certain she would not be staying the night.	Thinking it churlish not to at least say good morning before he went to see Harry Frank, Matthew took a cup of coffee down to the shop.  Jenny was at the desk with the mail.	“Good morning, sleep well?”  There was no irony in her voice.	“Yes thanks.  Brought you a coffee.”	She took the cup.  “Nothing exciting,” she pointed to the mail.	“I’m out for an hour or so.  See you when I get back.”	The business with Franks was pleasant and swift and armed with papers he made for the bank.  There, too, there were no hitches and within minutes he had signed for both accounts, had a temporary cheque book and access to the savings account.  The box was brought up from the strongroom and he signed for the contents.  Once again, he had no bag and they went through the same ritual as last time.  As so there he was, out on the street, plastic bag under his arm.  He hailed a taxi with no success and finally caught a bus back to Camden Lock. 		He locked the papers in the drawer of the desk and opened the Chasseur.  The snake and diamond was clearly printed on page thirty-two.  Well-cut wood block by the look of it; there were no other marks on the book.   He carefully turned through the pages.  It was a nice edition and for the collector a reasonable addition to any library.  Yet for Zollman it represented so much more.  He drew a piece of paper towards him and picked up a pen.  What was there to say?  Finally he wrote, “with the compliments of Matthew Vigor,” and left it at that. 	Bubble wrap and a box would see it undamaged and he would send it via carrier.  May as well make somebody’s day he thought to himself.  He finished the wrapping and looked at his watch.  The carrier came about three.  He would take it down to the shop to go out with the other mailings.	“Well, that’s that done,” He said to O.C. just as the intercom called his name.	“Yes Jenny?”	“Matthew, there’s that man asking for the Chasseur.”	“What?”	“The man who came just before the New Year, remember?”	He remembered, tall, thin, bad breath, unpleasant and persistent.	“I’ll be right down.”	He pushed the Chasseur further toward the back of the desk and closed the roller.		“Hern Zollman says I can collect the book.”  He was standing by the desk and he thrust a piece of paper at Matthew as he came toward him.	“Oh, does he?”  said Matthew reading the note.  ‘I am happy all is resolved in your favour. I hope that you remember your offer and I authorise the bearer to return the book to me.  D.Zollman.’	“You have it, please.”  	“No,” said Matthew watching the man’s face twist into disbelief and discomfort.	“But...”	“But what?”	“You have the property now.”	“Is that so?”	The man’s discomfort increased.	“And how do you know that?”	“Mienher Zollman tells me.”	“And how does he know?”	The man shrugged, “He did not say.”	“Please tell Mienher Zollman that he will have his book in a couple of days.”	The man did not move.	 “Do you wish to buy any other books?”	“No.”	“Then I think our business is done.  Goodby.”	Matthew walked to the door and opened it.  After a brief hesitation the man left and Matthew closed the door firmly behind him.	“The bank gave me the book,” Matthew said quietly to Jenny.	“You’ve got the will, I mean probate?”	“Yes,” said Matthew, “And the book is packed upstairs I was sending it out today with the carrier.”	“That’s quick.”	“I didn’t want it hanging about.”	“With good reason.  Do you think it is safe, the carrier I mean.”	Matthew looked puzzled.	“I can see him mugging the boy or trying to hijack the van.”	“That’s not so far fetched,” said Matthew.  “I Know, I”ll send it by post, can’t get a lot safer than that.”	“Assuming he’s not watching and tries for it on the way to the post office.”	He could tell she was only half joking.	“Call me a cab, I’ll go up and address it and take it door to door.”	Jenny reached for the phone.		By the time the cab came he had it addressed and with the return shop stamp on the back.	“Have to do a customs declaration,” He said as he left.	“Get proof of posting too, and insurance,” She called after him.		That night Jenny stayed and they made love for most of it.	“Tomorrow I”m going to go back to Angoulime, there’s one thing left I want to find out.”	She snuggled up against him, her warm damp thigh pressing against his.	“Fine,” she said sleepily, “I’ll be quite happy when all this is finally over.	Jenny was not the only one with that sentiment.														August 16th., 17th. and 18th. 1989.		The weather in Angoulime was hot and the town crowded.  He had found it difficult to find a seat on the train and he disembarked with a herd of children and holidaymakers.  	Just as well I called ahead to book a room, he thought and having seen the masses in flight from Paris he now appreciated the hotel clerk’s comment that he was very lucky as a cancellation has just made a room available for that week.  Not that he planned to stay that long.	Ignoring the plying taxis, he walked along the road toward the spire and the bridge.  Even this nondescript part of the town looked attractive in the bright sunshine.  As the road rose over the bridge he stopped to look at the river.  The shafts of sun cut through the clear water and revealed a bed of polished stones with small forests of current inclined weed.  Small fish darted from cover to cover while in the slow eddies behind one of the piers a brown trout lazily cruised in zig-zag patterns snapping at the dipping flies. The river-edging stone houses stretched out beside the flagged path that led along the bank where couples strolled, and children dipped at the clear water with tiny nets while sun hatted men sat dreaming by their rods or flicking tethered, feathered imitations in careful arcs across the bright reflecting pools.   For a moment Matthew stood transfixed, lost in a memory not his own.	The room was larger and this time looked out onto the cafes and shops of the main street.  He dumped his case on the bed and picked up the phone.  Yes, Belmond had received his message and would be free to see him at four.  Time for a shower and a coffee.  Refreshed and shaved he opted for sandals, jeans and a clean shirt. He sorted the papers he needed into an envelope and slipped them into his jacket pocket.  He wished he had a hat.  	Outside the light cut white, sapping colour, striking hard and hot.  The shadows, black blocks, inpenetrable.  An awning table emptied and he sat pushing the plates and cups to one side.  A waiter approached, he indicated coffee and was served.  He picked up an abandoned paper and read without attention.  Across the road a woman called to a child and he looked up. Out of the shadow, momentarily bleached and then lost in the sudden darkness he saw, he thought he saw, Marion.  He half rose then sat back.  Impossible, no, improbable, but the resemblance uncanny and it disturbed him.  They had not spoken since he had apologised for the destroyed lists and he knew she had not believed him. If it were her they would meet again, it was that sort of a town.  He finished his coffee.  		Belmond sat, as if he had not moved since January, and smiled at Matthew.	“All the papers are in order,” he slipped them back into the envelope.  “If you do not mind I will copy them for my records and for the court.”  He pulled a manila file towards him.  “Now for the information that I am sorry I had to make you wait so long to hear.  Your father was the sole and complete owner of Les Libres Antiquarian.  A small, but long established bookshop which I believe you have already visited, albiet briefly.”  He looked up at Matthew who nodded.  The shop has been rented to various tenants since 1952.  There have been three enquiries to purchase, including the present tenant.  All offers have been denied by me.”	Matthew looked puzzled.	“There are two main clauses in the lease.  Firstly the shop shall not be sold without the express approval of the owner, and your father made it clear that approval would not be forthcoming. The second clause is that no alterations, apart form painting, could be made to the fabric of the building under any circumstances.  This clause has also been adhered to.  The rent is payable to me and I then transfered it to the bank in Paris.  The rest you know.”  	“Why no alterations?”	“I do not know; there is no entry in the file as to reasons.  You must remember that I never met your father.”	“Did he ever come to Angoulime after 1952?”	“I do not know, but I suspect not.”	“You said the present tenants want to buy?”	“Yes.  And, if I may venture an opinion, it is to sell.  The rent is low because the profits of the shop are low and even with great remodeling I doubt if there would be a substantial increase in profitability.  The site and building, however have a value that if invested would produce more than the rent, assuming you invest well, that is.”	“The present tenants?”	“Young, they have dreams, and a child.”  Belmond pulled a plan from the file.  “As you can see there is a basement, two large rooms on the ground floor that are the shop, and then a small flat above.  I think they plan to build an extension.”	Matthew looked at the plan.  In so many ways familiar.	“Could they afford to buy?”	“With the banks help, of course.”	“Would it be possible to look round?”	“It can be arranged with proper notice.  You are now the owner.”  Belmond did not ask why, which was fortunate because Matthew did not have a ready answer, even to himself.	“Would you like me to arrange it?”	Matthew nodded and Belmond reached for the phone. 		Belmond had made it obvious to the Sardous that Matthew may well say ‘oui’, and so facilitate their dreams and they greeted him effusively the next morning giving him free run of their shop and home.  The stock was mainly local history, topography and travel. Marie Sardou spoke of her plans to add on a specialised travel agency at the back, with of course, more living rooms above it.  She had, she told him, been in the travel business before their marriage.  While she spoke, her husband, thin, almost transparent, like a page from a book with his life written on it, more than a man of flesh and blood, nodded his approval.  Matthew smiled encouragement.  He had already decided to sell; he did not want the shop, nor the little income.  More than anything he wanted to tie up the ends bequeathed him and find his own peace.	They went into the basement. Dry, old stonework built to last surrounded them.  Matthew ran his fingers along the walls.  His father had been here, too.  The brick arched up into a semi vaulting from the alcoves in a near perfect symmetry.  He looked again.  Something was wrong, the proportions did not balance.  He turned to the plans.  Four alcoves, perfect curves met in the centre.  Here they did not.  An alcove was missing.  The back wall was brick and came forward abutted to the stone blocks of the wall.  He looked more closely.  Abutted not at a natural joint, but mid block.  This was not the original end of the cellar.  He checked the plans again and paced the floor.   Four feet short of the measurement given.  He tapped the brick.  Solid.  A thought nagged at him.  When had the wall been built?  Neither Marie, nor Belmond knew.		“Well?”  Belmond was fiddling with a hook and fly held in a thin vice on a stand, he peered at it through a lens.	“I’ll sell,” said Matthew. “Can you have it valued?”	Belmond nodded, “I have a cousin.  He could come today, perhaps tomorrow.”	“You could handle all the necessary...”	“Of course, there will be fees and taxes.”	“Aren’t there always,” said Matthew standing up.  “I would like to know what is behind the brick.”	Belmond looked at him, the thin gut suspended between his fingers and the fly.  He shrugged.	“If that is what you want,” he said.  “I know a builder.”	“A cousin?”	Belmond lauged.	“Not this time.”	“Will the Sardous object?”	“If they know you are selling to them. I doubt it, they will probably consider it an English eccentricity.”	“So I’m sure do you.”	“Ouf, I am used to eccentricities in my business.”		All had been arranged and the next morning Matthew was back in the basement with an old man who had been in the trade since the end of the war and was now semi-retired while his son ran the business.  He unpacked worn tools from a canvas bag as he continued his life story and that of most of the town.  Upstairs Belmond and his cousin poked about, measured and calculated.	The mortar cut easily.	“Not well mixed,” the old man volunteered.  “Too much sand, gone like powder.”	He chipped and loosened the first brick.	“Done by an amateur, should go like rock if you know how to mix.”  	The second brick came out.	“It’s all in the mixing, that’s what people don’t realise.”	The hole widened.	“Ah ha.”	He pulled the bricks out stacking them on the floor.	“Not load bearing see, just a sham wall.”	The wooden sides of crates came into view.	“Have to take it all down to get them out.”	Matthew nodded and the old man set to with renewed gusto.		Four crates about the size of tea chests now sat in the middle of the cellar floor.  The bricks stacked neatly up by the wall they had hidden.  The dust and cement swept into a tidy pile.  Matthew looked at Belmond and Marie.	“They are marked Maurice Vigor,” said Belmond looking at Matthew as if he had known they were there.  “So by rights they are yours.”	Marie nodded.  If she was curious as to their contents she did not make it apparent.	“If monsieur would like privacy to open them?”  she said.	Matthew nodded and Belmond shrugged.	She brought him a crowbar and, with Belmond, returned to the shop closing the door at the top of the stairs behind them.  Now half certain what he would find, Matthew pried the lid from the first crate.  They were well packed with paper and dry as a bone.  He lifted the first one.  Then the second and third.  He tried the next crate and the next.  All the same.  Tightly packed, dry, valuable.  Two titles he remembered from the list Jenny had copied from the Jewish Library.  The rest were probably here, too.  He put them back and refastened the lids.  He knew what he would do with them.		“Old stock belonging to my father.”  	They listened without question.	“I’ve no idea why he put them there, but I wish to take them with me.”	Marie looked at Belmond. 	“They belong to you M. Vigor, you are entitled to do with them as you wish.”  He answered her doubt if she had any. 	“I will take them back to England,” he said.  “I will also be happy to sell you this shop at the price agreed with M. Belmond.”	Marie shook his hand, her face alive with smiles.  The boxes were forgotten.  Now there could be another child.  Her thank yous followed them from the shop.		Matthew signed papers as Belmond passed them across the desk.	“I will forward the money to the Paris bank,” he said. “It should not take more than a couple of months.”	Matthew nodded, he was thinking about the boxes.	“You may find it cheaper to have them shipped,” said Belmond reading the thoughts.	So it was left at that.  A phone call arranged for them to be picked up the next day, the boxes wire sealed and sent direct to the Jewish library.  Matthew would call Jenny for the number and he would talk to the librarian.  He did not think they would make a fuss about it.		He had just fallen asleep when he imagined a tap on the door.  He turned over.  The tap became a knock.	“Who’s there?”	No answer, just another knock.	He got up and pulled on his trousers cursing quietly.  He opened the door and Ernst Todt stepped quickly into the room.	“Please forgive the lateness of the hour and the intrusion.”	Matthew closed the door.  Todt was alone.	“I gather that you have found something of Maurice’s.”	“Four crates of Jewish books,” said Matthew.	“Just books?”	“I only saw books,” he replied.	“I did not know that Maurice had this shop once,” said Todt with surprise in his voice.	“Then how...”	“I hear things,” he said.  “I heard that you were coming back and that you had been once already. I was curious.”	Perhaps it had been Marion, she appeared to have a way of hearing things, too.	Todt looked at him, the question in his eyes.	Matthew told him.	“Ah, that is indeed possible, thank you. I would not like her or her friends to know I am here.” He paused.  “Matthew, I would like to look at the boxes before you do whatever it is you want to do with them.”	“I saw only books.”	“Never the less, I would like to look.”	“The carriers are coming in the morning.”	“Then we will be there first.”		Of course they had no objection.  If M. Vigor and his friend wished to check the books before they were sealed, then they should check them.  Coffee was offered, accepted and carried into the basement with the crowbar.  The door once again shut behind them.  Matthew began to unload the books and stack them on the floor.  Todt watched.	“There were only four boxes?”	“Only four.”	“Six were sent.”	“Perhaps two were destroyed in the fire.”	“Perhaps,” said Todt.	Matthew kept stacking and emptying.  Todt did not touch the books.  Finally all four crates had been emptied.  Todt looked inside, then at the pile. 	“Thank you, Matthew. I appreciate your understanding if not your sympathies.”  Todt held out his hand.  “I think I can assure you that you will have no cause to be troubled by all this again. I also appreciate the loss of the lists.”  He smiled.  “By the way, do keep reading the papers - the next few months will be very eventful.”  He laughed softly.  “Harvest time, you know.”  He climbed the stairs, pulled the door shut and was gone.	Matthew began to replace the books.	As he began to pack the second crate, he stopped.  One book did not belong, neither had noticed it before.  It was leather bound, but neither old, nor Jewish.  Alfred Rosenberg, The Myth of the Twentieth Century.  Matthew tried to open it, but the pages were  stuck shut.  He put it aside and continued repacking.  Finally done with the lids secured, he picked up the Rosenberg and drapped his jacket over it - not a book to be seen with.  As he began up the stairs there was a knock on the door.	“The carriers are here, M.Vigor.”	He called them down.  Two men in overalls.  One carrying a roll of steel tape and a lever clamp.  He watched them seal the crates and then followed the first of the crates as it was carried up the stairs through the shop and into the truck.  He bade goodbye and good luck to the Sardous.	He decided to call the library from home, he would be back before the crates.  He called Belmond.  All was fine there, he would call Matthew in England if he needed anything.  He tossed the Rosenberg into his case, booked out and walked toward the station.  His business in Angoulime was done, that chapter finally closed.August 20th. to 24th.1989.		Matthew was glad to be home.  A good night’s sleep had him recovered from the travelling.  As for the Jewish books, today he would inform the librarian that they were on their way.  Finally that was that slate washed as clean as he could make it.  He poured himself another cup of coffee.  There was a letter from the medical board, he had a final appointment with the physician on the 2nd of September.  There was also a letter from the L.E.A.  He had an interview with the Retirement and Review people on the 29th. It looked like that his teaching career was all over bar the shouting.  Well, back to the shop.  There was work to be done.  He suddenly remembered the Rosenberg.  He walked into the lounge and picked it up from the desk.   Why had Maurice stuck it shut?  Assuming it had been Maurice.  He examined it carefully from all angles - just a book that did not open.  He brought a knife from the kitchen and holding the book firmly on the desk he inserted the knife between the cover and what he guessed to be the first page.  Despite a lot of pressure the knife hardly penetrated.	“This is some glue,” he muttered to himself.	He tried the blade a little way into the pages.  The first inch or so was free and he could slide the knife so far without trouble.  Then he hit a resistance. 	“O.K., lets try a hacksaw.”  It would chew up the book, but then it was ruined as a book anyway.	He rummaged about and found the one from the shop tool kit that he had brought up when he had cut off a piece of old pipe in the bathroom.  This time, angling the saw at the corner he made headway and soon had enough space to bend back the covers and wrench the book apart.	There in the central compartment that had been carefully cut into the pages was a spool of film.  He lifted it out.	“What the hell are you about?”	He unwound a little and held it up to the light.  It was black and white and difficult to make anything out.  He unwound more as far as a splice, still difficult to see clearly.  He could make out figures, some sort of buildings, that was about it.  He rewound and put the spool back into its compartment.  The cover was bent back and would not close properly.  He put the book in the drawer.	“I’m going to need a projector to see you,” he said.  “Eight milimeter by the look of it.”	He went down to the shop.		“Know where I can get an eight mil. projector?”	“Jenny looked up from the ledger.”	“Buy or borrow?”	“Borrow.”	“There’s a shop in Primrose Hill has that sort of stuff, I’ll look it up in the Yellow Pages.  Why?”	“There’s some old film I’ve found, want to see it.”	He would tell her about Angoulime and the books later.  They settled to work.  Customers came and went and while they were quiet he went over the catalogue for the next sale.  The more he read and pottered about the more he knew he could be happy doing this for the forseeable future.		The next few days passed in similar vein. He had to admit that Jenny’s response to his donation to the Jewish Library was not what she had expected.  She had not said a lot, but he sensed a disapproval as if she would have done something else with them, though she did not say what.  The projector  rental shop was closed until next Monday, so he left it till they opened.  He didn’t see any urgency, just curiosity.  He was just closing up on the Thursday, Jenny had taken the afternoon off to go to the hairdressers - she was going to the  wedding of an old friend on Saturday and was having Friday off to be at the Hen party when two men knocked on the door.	“Mr. Matthew Vigor?”	 He let them in taking them by their demeanor as policemen.	“I wonder if you would answer some questions for us, Mr.Vigor?”	The speaker left it in no doubt that he expected his questions answered.	Matthew nodded and went with them to the back of the shop.	The one who had not spoken placed a photgraph on the desk.  Then he spoke.	“I’d like you to look very carefully at this picture and tell me if you have ever seen the man.”	Matthew looked at the picture.  Grainy, black and white, as if taken from a long way with a telephoto.  He stared.	“No, I’ve never seen him.”	Another photo was placed in front of him	“No.”	Another.	“No.”	While one fed him photos the other man walked about the shop looking at the books.	He came back to the table.	“Are you a Nazi?”	No.”	“You have a lot of very Nazi books.”	“I have Marxist books and I’m not a Marxist.”	The photo man laughed, “A liberal?”	Matthew said nothing.	Another photo.	Matthew looked hard and felt his chest tighten.  It was Marion.  She was lying on the ground, face to the side.  There was a black patch about her head, her legs were twisted to the side, her dress up exposing a thigh.  She looked like a flower with a broken stem. He could not supress a shudder.	“Nasty, eh.”	“Yes.”	“Know her?”	Matthew paused, “Yes.”	“Name.”	“Marion Zollman.”	“How do you know her?”	“I met her about a book her uncle wanted.”	“Name?”	“David Zollman.”	“Address.”	“I’d have to look it up, Amsterdam.”	“See her anywhere else?”	“No.”	“Been abroad recently?”	“Yes, Angoulime, France.”	“See her there?”	“No.  Well, no I didn’t see her, but I thought I might have.”	“Did you see her, or not?”	“No, like I said.”	The book looker bent close to him.  “Think, did you see her.”	“No.  I saw someone who made me think it was her.”	“You should know, you slept with her.”	“No.”	Another photo, Marion and him kissing by the canal.	“I didn’t sleep with her.”	“Sure?”	“Yes.  Is she dead?”	Photoman looked at bookman and then at the photo .	“Yes, she’s dead, fell out of her hotel window.”  Photoman obviously had a macabre sense of humour.	“In Angoulime, France,” said bookman.	“When?”	“The same time you were in Angoulime.”	Matthew was feeling sick.	“Know this man?”	It was a picture of Julien, taken a few years ago.	“Yes.”	“He’s dead, too.”  said book man.	“You know a lot of dead people.”  said photoman.	“Are you police?”	“Sort of,” said Bookman.	“Know this one?”  Photoman pushed a picture in front of him.	Matthew looked.  They had been in the shop together, people had seen them together.	“Yes.”	“Name.”	“Ernst Todt.”	“How?”	“What?”	“How do you know him?”	That was a difficult question.	“I’m a bookdealer.  There were books in the shop, he was interested in them.”	“You’re a teacher.”	“Not now.”	The two men looked at each other.	“Tell us about Todt.”	“He knew my father at this shop.  He knew I was taking it over,”  Matthew was thinking fast.	“Did you tell him you were going to Angoulime?”	“No.”	“So how come he was there?”	“I don’t know.”	“Coincidence?”	“Possibly.”	“Who owns the shop in Angoulime?”	“I do, but I’m selling it.”	“To whom?”	“The tenants.”	“Not to Todt.”	“No.”	“Did you give or sell anything to Todt?”	“No.  He just looked at some books and then left.”	“Where are the books?”	“I’m having them shipped to England.”	“Where in England?”	“The Jewish Library.  Call them.”	“Sale?”	“No, gift.”	“Conscience.”	Matthew made no answer.	Both men straightened up.	Bookman spoke.	“Mr. Vigor, I must warn you that you are in a very insecure position.  I would like to give you some advice that you would be wise, very wise to heed.  This is a dangerous world.  Stick to books, or to teaching.  Stick to safe ordinary everyday books.  Do you get my meaning?”	“Yes,” said Matthew.	“I hope we don’t have to see you again.”	Photoman collected the pictures and put them in his pocket.  Both men walked to the door.	“Oh, Mr. Vigor, if Herr Todt was to visit you again, we would like to know.”	The door shut behind them.	Matthew sat for awhile and then got up and locked the door.  They hadn’t said how to contact them, but somehow he didn’t think that would be a problem.	That night he slept badly.		It took a long time for Monday to come, even though he had been busy on Friday and the weekend.  He cleared all the right wing shelves, and the Marxist stuff.  He drove them to the tip and left them there scattered among the rubbish and seagulls.  Jenny noticed the empty shelves immediately.	“Why?’	“I’ve decided not to stock or sell any politics at all,” he said.  She gave him a long expressionless look.  They spoke little that day and she went home at five.	Tuesday meant the film shop was open.  By eleven he had the projector set up in the lounge above the shop.  He drew the curtains and fitted the spool as he had been shown.  It was a fiddly job and it took him a couple of tries.  He flipped the switch.		There was no soundtrack.  The images flickered.  A car with motorcycle escort drew up and stopped.  The camera panned and fixed on a sign.  Auschwitz.  Clouds scudded in a grey sky.  The camera followed a coated figure walking through the gate and then came to the side.  Fallen tents and a few huts came into view.  There was a cut.  Then thin, part-clothed people poured out of the huts and made a ragged line. The coated figure walked along them.  The camera pulled in close and then to the front.  Matthew was staring right into the face of Adolf Hitler.  The camera went inside, rack by rack of people.  The figure walked looking.  Cut.  Another camp, Bergen Belsen, said the sign.  Walking, looking, gesturing.  Cut.  The same figure, Mauthausen, Stutthof, Buchenwld, Dachau.  Cut.  Young men, naked, by a lake, horseplay. Swimming. The film flicked through the gate and the reel spun.  Flick, flick, flick, flick, flick.flickflickflick.	Matthew got up and switched off the projector.	“Oh my God.  He knew, he knew.”	He sat down again.	There were no films, no records, not even a quote that Hitler had ever been near a Concentration or Death Camp.  Apologists even said he did not know what was being done and here was proof - absolute raw, uncut proof that he knew.	“So this is what Todt wanted. No wonder.”	This is what Todt had filmed. And what else had he recorded now lost or hidden?             “What are you going to do with it, Matthew?”	Jenny’s voice behind him made him jump.	“You saw it?”	“Yes.”	“It’s terrible.”	“And what are you going to do with it?”	“I don’t know.”	She came close and put her hands on his shoulders.	“A lot of people would like this film.”	“I know.”	“And a lot of people would like to see this film destroyed or safe.”	“I know.”	“So what are you going to do with it? Give it to the Jewish Library?”  Her tone was flat.	“No.”	“Then what?”	“Possibly the Imperial War Museum.”	 “Not Todt? It’s his film”.		“No, I’ve got to think.”	“What else is there...”	“For Christ’s sake let me think.”	He hadn’t meant to shout.  Jenny moved a little away and shuffled some papers on the table.	“Lunch?”  she said suddenly.	He shook his head.  “Where did you put the lists?”	“In the old tool box.”	“This should go there, too, until we know what to do with it.  Bring me some cling film.”	She went into the kitchen as he took the film off the projector and reboxed the machine.	“I don’t want to see that again,” he said as he wrapped the film and bound it with tape from the desk.	“Do you want me to put it with the lists?”	“No, I’ll do it.”  He went down stairs and slipped it into the envelope that held the lists.  He sealed that, too.	Jenny came down.	“You’ve got to eat,” she said.  “I’ve made coffee and a simple sandwich.”	He shook his head.	“Go,” she said.	He went back to the flat and poured a coffee.  He couldn’t face the sandwich.	He heard the shop bell ring.	He poured a coffee for Jenny and went down to the shop.	It was empty.	The lid of the tool box was open.  The envelope was gone. Lists and film.	There was a note on the desk.		‘Matthew,	At least you made a choice.  I’m sorry it was the wrong one.”					Jenny.			October 9th. 1989.		A mass demonstration took place without violence in Leipzig.
